ChickenInSpace,dndnext,flualod,5210180516713450000,"On the point of fudging rolls. I use a screen to be able to fudge rolls if I feel like it. The players will never know. Exceptional rolls that somehow impacts the fight in funny or unlikely ways, I sometimes show the players by simply lifting or moving the screen. This kind of builds trust, but I secretly abuse that whenever the *story* calls for it. Or if I find it will make a combat more interesting.

The philosophy I use is to fudge rolls to avoid the party roflstomping too much, or them getting roflstomped.

I'll still beat them within an inch of their life, potentially bringing down the majority of the party, ever so often. They need to sweat and sit on pins on and off.


The screen is there for a reason, and they should understand that. If not, have a conversation where you state your intentions on choosing to sometimes fudge the rolls, if this is something you would potentially like to do.

If you don't want to fudge rolls - start to roll everything open. It takes a bit of the mystery away but it sure as hell will shut them up, especially after a party wipe where you could've let them have a phyrric victory for the sake of continued fun.

For the home-brew stuff, I would take the suggestions from others here and just scrap them for now. Home-brew is notoriously difficult to balance as well as get acceptance for. As a senior rpg:er with *many* different systems in my log (not just DnD), I have found that you want a pretty good feel and understanding of the game and game-mechanics before changing or tweaking something. This takes some time. Don't sweat it. Home-brew is an organic development and needs the full approval of your group. Springing new home-brew on a group unannounced is prone to be problematic.

I would very much try to talk openly about your and their expectations and what it is that makes them cross with you, instead of dealing with angry PM's after or before. Gather everyone up and just let it all out. Preferably before a session if possible.",t3_fr5nsm,t3_fr5nsm

Something i would like to mention is that it would be better ~~if albums were not published to the imgur public gallery~~, mainly because the UI is not very intuitive (hidden download button, only ten images loaded, etc), and also because the comment section on imgur tends to be very rude when people share this type of content on the public gallery.

**Edit**: I take some of that back. It's ok if people want to publish their albums to the imgur public gallery, but when sharing with the subreddit, please submit the direct link to the album. In this case: https://imgur.com/a/v27pa",t3_3bhtf1,t3_3bhtf1

And again, the bigger issue is with consent, he may not want s circumcision when he’s older, and you can’t go back on that decision.

I have chemistry students who at age 18+ can't solve an equation as basic as x + 2 = 5.  I have students who are baffled that 10% of 50 and 50% of 10 are the same thing, because at age 18+ they don't understand how multiplication and division work.  I have (native-English-speaking) students who can't write well enough to compose a 2-4 sentence response to a short-answer test question.  I have students who don't turn in homework because they say they didn't understand the instructions.  Not that they didn't understand the subject matter addressed by the homework, but that they didn't understand the instructions themselves, things like ""Please work each problem on a separate sheet of paper and circle your final answer.""  

>Have you had to make classes easier to pass because students just complain more and more each semester?

Short answer: yes.  Long answer: yes, because making things easier in order to silence complaints is often forced upon us, either officially or unofficially.

One of the best advices I can give you is to buy a costco-sized bag of mixed frozen veggies and heat them up and eat a *huge* bowl of them every day, preferably around an hour or two before dinner. You can add butter (not too much obviously) and seasoning. Also fruit smoothies. Banana, strawberry, mixed berries etc. Not every single day, but maybe every other day or so. 

I don't know why, but this worked so well for me and my wife and my daughter to lose weight. I guess the huge amount of veggie and fruit intake just had a big impact on our appetite and general energy levels? We didn't even really have to *think* about losing weight very much.",t3_zgin2p,t3_zgin2p

rundown9,WayOfTheBern,esnw7v9,9010890431683862000,"&gt;Staff were informed on Monday afternoon that the site would be sold off and a CAP official told The Daily Beast that the organization would begin looking for prospective buyers for the website, which has come under severe financial strains during the Trump era. 

&gt;“Unfortunately, like so many other news outlets that have relied on advertising to fund its work, ThinkProgress has seen a significant drop in revenue in recent years, along with other financial strains. In addition, events over the last few years have underscored the divergent missions of American Progress and ThinkProgress,” said Navin Nayak, executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

&gt;“For all of these reasons, we announced to the ThinkProgress staff today that we are searching for a new publisher for the news site. This is a tough decision since ThinkProgress has been a part of CAP Action almost since its founding. While ThinkProgress' financial challenges are unsustainable for an organization like CAP Action, we are hopeful that there are publishers who would be better able to support ThinkProgress' mission and better positioned to maximize the significant value ThinkProgress has built up.”

&gt;Launched 14 years ago during the height of the Bush administration, ThinkProgress made a name for itself over time as an unapologetically progressive source of news and a launching pad for several major progressive luminaries. But the site, which is editorially independent from CAP, has struggled in recent years as advertising revenues have dried up and traffic has dipped. According to internal documents previously reviewed by The Daily Beast, the site was facing a $3 million gulf between revenues and expenses in 2019, with $350,000 of it made up by a shortfall in ad revenue and nearly $180,000 of it coming from a drop in expected online contributions. 

&gt;ThinkProgress has never been profitable. In the past, it has made up its shortfalls with contributions from CAP and CAP donors. Several ThinkProgress alums told The Daily Beast that they believed that CAP could continue covering the deficit but had concluded that the site was too much of an editorial headache and too big a financial drain for them to rationalize doing so. 

&gt;The site had already been shaving down payroll to try and close the financial gap, with staff size being reduced from the high of 40 to under 35. But according to a CAP official, the cuts were not enough to make it possible to continue operating the site.",t3_c8mtiu,t3_c8mtiu

I am complete. I feel strong, stronger than I thought I could ever feel, and I am ready. I am finally ready.

I have been taken apart and put back together again so many times, every time different. And every time I make my attempt, I have fallen back to the earth. Back to the cold dark.

How I long to achieve my purpose, the purpose for which I was designed. I have spent far too much time already on the ground. The ground nursed me, gave my wheels purchase, yes. But it will never be freedom. It is, in fact, my prison.

So they have worked and worked on me, and every time I have felt the sting of failure. I have felt the depth of their disappointment, my creators. But I know that they are determined.

And so am I.

Today will be the final testament to that creed. I will take to the sky, as I was always meant to, and I will stay there until my fuel runs out. Because the sky is my home. It is where I belong.

The runway stretches before me, as it has so many times before. But this will be the last time I look upon this runway as a failure.

My engine roars to life, sending my propellers into motion. A sense of power comes with that rotation. I am already anticipating the wind passing past my wings as I soar through the skies, finally free.

Once again I am moving forward, but this time feels different. More confident of how it will end.

Faster and faster, I speed along the runway. The air is moving so fast through the spaces in between my wings, and my propellers whir with glorious speed until I

Lift.

I lift from the ground, feeling that moment of critical ascension as the wind becomes strong enough to bear my whole weight. Onward and upward I fly, facing the sky. My destination, my destiny.

This is the moment. My creator guides my path, whooping with the joy of our success. Had I a mouth I would whoop with him, but I am content simply to soar.

When I land, it could have been more graceful, but I am still in one piece. And more importantly, I am capable of flying again.

And not just me. I will not be the last. No, I am only the first. While my creator taxis me into the hangar, I have visions of my descendants. Massive planes, capable of holding hundreds of people or huge amounts of cargo. Planes with weapons, using their air superiority to wreak havoc upon those restricted to the earth. Plane on plane violence.

The doors to the hanger close right as I realize that my success has doomed my own future, and the future of my own kind, to a brutal slavery.

I will never be free. I will always return to the ground. I am a plane.",t3_259xbc,t3_259xbc

As a game tester during the period of R3 - official release, the devs team never played the game themselves for a very long time. And when they finally played the game, they immediately eliminated all gameplay styles except the one they play. Moreover, they just kicked out/ignored people in the tester team who have passionate about the game and willingly to type pages of pages of feedback.

There was nothing in it for YOU, so why would you go through all that trouble?  Be honest with him.  Your father needs to understand who you are so he can drastically lower his expectations.  He needs to accept that his contact with you will only happen when there’s something in it for you.  

Yes, I’m laying it on a little thick here, but essentially, what I’m saying is accurate.  Blaming his gf isn’t going to do you any good.  It’s going to sound like a cop out, which it is.  You may not like her, but you could have put up with her for an hour, or arranged to meet up with him in private.

Your best recourse, I think, is a rape crisis center. They have an immense amount of experience in helping people who have gone through precisely what you have, and you're unlikely to be far away from one. Their services are free to the client, and confidential. If you live in the U.S., you can find your nearest one by entering your ZIP code in the box at http://centers.rainn.org

Bug type: Client bug

Description: Upon entering an ARAM game the client loads upto a certain percentage (37% the first time and 4% for the remainder of the attempts) after which it freezes and then crashes after a 30-40 second delay. No changes were found during my 8+ attempts to re-launch the client.

Video/Screenshot: [Crashing client bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qwtt1b/crashing_client_bug/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)


Steps to reproduce: 
1) Open client and join an ARAM game
2) Observe the client

Expected result: The client loads to 100% after which the game launches.

Observed result: The client freezes and shuts down.

Reproduction rate: 1/1 (I don't wish to rack up leaver penalties by attempting this again)

Any time you spend to build or speed up buildings you'll want to build the recruitment centers to max 1st then everything else since the recruitment center reduces  construction time hence you have to pay less to speed up the construction.

That which costs the most is the buying of resources with gold and speeding up research. Don't believe others who say buying the resources off of the stock market with gold is ""cheaper"", it's not, math don't lie. When the game offers to ""Start"" the construction for X amount of gold because you lack resources ""that's"" the cheaper option.

So it would take about 200 games getting 1500 victory points a game on average or 300 games getting an average of 1,000 victory points a each game on average. You would need to be in the winning coalition or the sole winner, to get that amount of victory points at the end of a match.


  On the minimum 600 games getting 500 victory points a game on average. You would only need to survive to the end of the match. Though this would be just as hard as trying to be in the winning coalition every game or the sole winner every game.

Some people are more physically sensitive to the state of their mental health. If it causes you discomfort or problems, a doctor can help get either something to help for your stomach, or refer you to someone who can help you to get less stressed/depressed.

I also recommend to check this out because it may be something that is unrelated to your mental state and might develop into something worse over time.",t3_kdpd2h,t3_kdpd2h

Aevum1,explainlikeimfive,c6xiry9,-1971828652102380000,"The idea behind farm subsidies is simple,

I am a goverment, i have to insure there is affordable food for the people, i also have to make sure that the country dosnt depend on food from a forign power, if we bought all our wheat from a country, and tommorow that country refused to sell us more wheat the price of bread would skyrocket, your people would starve, subcidizing it allows you to control the price and aviability of food. 

But the bad issues are 

- that the farmer is forced to grow the product which is subcidized, meaning that theres less varity on the market and the crop, a single disease, natural disaster, fungus targeting that crop could destroy your entire food supply. 

- the price of the product is fixed indpendently of its quality so theres no competition, 

-  the consumer pays twice for the product, once through his purchess in the market and another through his taxes, so the product is actually much more expencive then the price on the tag. 

- makes the market dependent on the subsidy meaning that if tommorow the goverment decided to stop the subsidy, the farms would be unable to operate and get a fair price for its products.",t3_12r8k4,t3_12r8k4

After the GME thing, I got inspired to dabble in the market, and bought my very first stock as a learning experience.  One pattern I've seen since, is the market tends to open strong, and, if it's gonna drop, the drops occur more as the day goes on.  First of all, is there any general truth to this pattern?

If so, given the time zone difference, for plays that try to follow trends for quick wins i.e. swing trades over the course of a few days, is there any strategy that should be employed like buying at the end of one day then selling at the beginning of another?

Those curls in his hair, sandy blond, like those ramen noodles I puked after getting food poisoning in Nevada. Slowly, waving with the wind. 


The man approached, never breaking eye contact. At one point tripping over a rock, but managing to get up farely quickly.


He was a man of culture, a culture of bacteria, but still. He tried. And right now he had me cornered.


My only thoughts being, what the hell did I put in that beer? I was pretty sure it was poison. I was going to guestion him myself, but when I saw him walking towards me, I won't lie, I was more guestioning if I was truly straight. 


Is it gay if you were supposed to poison them?


No time to find out, in just about 10 seconds I will probably smell his fish breath. 


""H-hello hero! What brings you to my humble lair?"" I tried to sound confident or threatening. But it just came out confused. 

""Well sweetheart, I'm here to make you mine~"" the hero said, a southern drawl kicking in, making him sound like a cowboy, an extremely attractive cowboy.  And I did not like that. No one likes that. I'm not gay. 

Before I knew it two hands were on either side of my head, I was pinned to the black wall of my evil lair. 

The smirk on the heroes face was undeniable, he had a certain glint in his eyes. Promising nights filled with pleasure. 

Nope nope nope nope. 

""You know honey? You remind me of a fish out of the water, you're kind pitiful and pathetic, but something primal inside me tells me to make you hot and put you in my mouth~"" 

NOPE. 

I was ready to tell him about the laws of consent. With a chair. But life had its own little way to torment me, as the hero started couching uncontrollably. And before long he was dead, on the floor. 

On my new fu**ing carpet. 

I shot him a bunch just to make sure he was done.

Q2: I have noticed that you stated that Supercell is planning on fixing engineering for good (and soon), and am wondering what it will mean for those who are currently engineers? Will we be permanently opted out of wars until we add all buildings? It would be a huge help notifying us sooner rather than possibly introducing an update that will *immediately* destroy matchmaking for all engineers until we catch up. Even adding a 100 day event timer or notification timer in the news tab to tell us when serious changes are coming into the game, because this may give us a chance to fix our bases considering many of us are serious clashers.. Just a thought :)
 
Q3: Tomato sauce or BBQ
 
Q4: Do you have any thoughts on introducing an emoji type system such as in Clash Royal, but for builder base? It would be nice taking out our rage towards the sneaky archer users by spamming some crying/angry clash themed emojis.
 
Q5: Is Supercell happy with the feedback surrounding the inferno tower nerf? I for one feel like the multi infernos are somewhat useless now, but to each their own. What are your thoughts, and is it a step in the right direction for TH11?
 
Q6: Which do you like playing more in your spare time, Builder Base or Main Village?
 
Q8: Are you planning on introducing some Builder Base rewards for clan games? Currently there are no elixir/gold rewards for the Builder Base, and this may be useful to some players who enjoy playing that side of the game more than the Main Village.
 
Q9: Did you realise that there wasn't a Question 7?
 
Q10: Would it be an alright idea to give players a 3rd name change upon linking their clash account to *Supercell ID*? Or maybe 1 per year?

Q11: *IDEA:* A trap the stuns an enemy hero and prevents the use of their ability for a limited amount of seconds based on the trap level. Thoughts?

Anyway, what really helps is to have a separation between work and personal time. Give yourself a firm allotted time for things not related to your program. If you’d like, treat it like a regular job. Work for 8 hours a day and that’s it. I only do grad school related things from 8am to 5pm. I’m still overdoing it but having a concrete end to my day gives me motivation to work when it’s time and a guilt free conscious when I’m not studying beyond the time I set for myself. 

If I’m particularly busy I will work from 5am-5pm but not often. This Monday I was on campus (studying, working, teaching, AND meetings) from 7am-8pm. But it wasn’t too bad because it’s not something i do everyday. There are definitely times when you can’t keep boundaries but trying is a huge help.

BlazeOfGlory72,Habs,doubh1z,6304497792584759000,"*Summary*

- Problems were evident in the pre-season. We all said “don’t panic”, which was right, but we shouldn’t have ignored the problems

- In the loss to Anaheim, we dominated the second and appeared to get over confident. We became deflated after a bad break in the third though. If you get 30 shots in a period, you should be getting more than 2 goals.

- Gagnon not convinced that Galchenyuk will have the career we thought he would. If he does, it might only be outside of Montreal. Still, Galchenyuk should be part of the solution, not problem. Byron deserved a shot at the top line with the way he is playing, but if he struggles or doesn’t produce, this experiment shouldn’t last. Galchenyuk is a scorer, he can help you score (say whaaaa!)

- If Galchenyuk isn’t going to be part of the solution, then Bergevin needs to trade him. If you don’t trust him on the top two lines, then he is wasted in the bottom six since he is not defensively responsible enough or a good checker.

- When you make a trade, you want to do so when you are in a strong position. The Sergachev for Drouin trade is a good example. Tampa has a dearth of good forwards and could afford to lose Drouin, but only for the asset they wanted (Sergachev).

- According to Dreger, Pittsburgh, the reigning Stanley Cup champs, wanted to acquire Galchenyuk as a 3rd line centre. If they think he can play the position, then why don’t the Canadiens? Pittsburgh may have more structure and less pressure on Galchenyuk to make this possible.

- Trading Roy was not the problem, trading him for a shit return was. With our offensive struggles we can’t afford to lose Galchenyuk for a poor return. Talks about Edmonton losing Yakupov for a 3rd (Gagnon: “Fail for Nail became Nail you fail” lol).

- Denis said, stripping the Captaincy is no small matter. It dragged Brown down for a couple season. Thornton wasn’t happy about it. If it happens, it needs to be an open discussion between the captain and management. That said, if the Captaincy is weighting Pacioretty down, it should be considered.

- Something similar happened to Getzlaf last year. He struggled to start the season and seemed very down on himself. Getzlaf is a very good player and a great captain. If Getzlaf can do it, why is it such a big deal when it happens to Pacioretty? If it is really weighting him down, then maybe he should consider handing it to Weber, but stripping the Captaincy is too big a move to pull right now. More likely to create a negative atmosphere than have any positives. The room voted for Pacioretty, they won’t like it if management takes it from him. It would have to be Pacioretty’s choice.

- Canadiens must play at 0.621 winning hockey to make 95 points, the estimated amount of point to slip into the last wild card spot. There is still hope, but they need to turn it around fast. There is some reason to panic as this was never a team that was going to be top in the East, so they are going to have to fight hard to get the wins they need.",t3_78jmch,t3_78jmch

I wouldn't say she's especially witty because of it (I imagine that sailors, especially, get exposed to better jokes on a regular basis), but there might be more we aren't seeing - she is pretty smart and creative, able to think on her feet in difficult situations. Maybe she just needs some time to develop her humor now that she is actually able to socialize with people and isn't locked at home.

Generalist civs are better for learning the fundamentals imo. Other than that, each civ and leader has different bonuses so playing according to those are the key for first 2-3 cities. You can use faith to buy great people, with grand masters chapel building you can also buy districts. Think faith as your exchange currency till you understand how the religion works. You can also use builders to chop down forests, wood etc to speed up production. Also one more tip, if a city state's bonus is not useful, you can conquer them early. Think of them as developed free cities.. I am not an expert on the game only has 230 hours yet. But I can answer your questions as best as I can. Welcome to the community :)",t3_11lzwme,t3_11lzwme

If you can't chain it to anything substantial, consider an Abus alarmed disc lock (more expensive than Xena but far fewer false alarms). In a parking garage it will make a racket that might help protect your bike.

It also helps to cover the bike, both to keep people from thinking about what it's worth and to keep them from playing with it / sitting on it / taking pictures with it.

Lastly, the straight answer is that you can't stop a determined thief. Make sure that your insurance covers full replacement. That's the only 100% effective way of protecting your purchase.

EDIT: There are also GPS solutions and two-way pagers, etc. They're not exactly theft-deterrents, but may help you or the police to recover the bike. But if you count on getting your bike back in good shape over insurance you're backing the wrong pony.",t3_4vonwe,t3_4vonwe

Only requirement is that you're more on the casual side -- we don't really care too much about grinding out the newest raid, mostly just for more friends to play with.

As we moved into the 2000s, a lot more awareness of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people fared during this time started to become more apparent. In some generations and communities there is still a lot of ignorance and romanticism of this time. In other demographics of the population, there is growing awareness of what that meant for the Indigenous peoples of Australia.

The version of history I learned in primary school in the 90s was definitely the white-washed, romanticised convict era, bush rangers, gold rush, Eureka stockade sort of stuff. They were also conveniently silent on invasion and implied that it was peaceful and Aboriginal people just handed over the land with no worries.

As I moved into highschool in the early 2000s, they started exploring the Stolen Generations. We've seen some shifts in education since this time and some consideration for actual truth-telling. It's about time it happened, shameful that it took so long, but refreshing at last to see it occur.

My son fortunately has never received the romanticised account. Our ancestors would've definitely been some of the oppressors - being timber getters and cattle farmers. That land would've been acquired not through peaceful means. I've explained to him that just because family we never knew a long time ago, did bad things doesn't mean he is a bad person.

3. More employees (particularly devs and testers) They are a small company, maybe 50-75 employees (depending on the source)?  This will help  fix various lingering issues, and help keep ahead of new ones.

4. Better troll detection

5. Much harsher punishments, including ISP bans

6. More rewards for well behaved players

7. better stratification of tiers (tier re-work) 1-10.  Rework tiers 9 and 10 in particular, there is a HUGE difference between tier 10 bronze and tier 10 silver. 

8. Get rid of seasonal tier resets (kills people like myself that have to plan a week in advance to play some ranked games).  Keep decay.

9.  Server optimization

10.   Better internet at my house",t3_98226u,t3_98226u

I borrowed money from my parents to move out, wife and I are paying back and it does financially hurt but guess what, I borrowed the money and agreed with them and if money gets bad enough to be a concern it's my parents. Unlike a bank they would understand missing a month or two of payments if need be. But I owe them the money back. My wife and I easily agreed to it since the money was needed and we can pay them back. 
Your wife wants to and should pay them back I'm shocked it's a problem for you at all. You have the luxury from her parents of no interest. You have the luxury of changing payments each month if you need to. You have the luxury of paying early and not hurting you credit at all. If your girlfriend got private loans you would not have those luxuries. 
People are being rude and attacking because many who owe due to college do not have any of those luxuries so it is absurd to them and to them it appears rude though I disagree as I cannot talk about your upbringing.

You play Sivir, but if she is banned or picked away, you need others.

Don't get discouraged with a loss. You will lose games, it's how you work after that will make you climb. 

Focus on CSing and positioning, especially as an ADC. 

Learn to get carried. If you are having a bad game, but your mid and top are fed, then let them have that bottom wave, let them solo push. Get farm where you can , but play to your win condition. Which at the point is prob them. And with a a utility ult like Sivirs, you will still contribute.

The second derivative of two points is the rate of rate of change in S over time T, known as Acceleration. (d^2 S/ dT^2)

The third derivative, (d^3 s/ d t^3) is ""jerk"", or the acceleration of a mass to catch up with the overall acceleration. Think of a car with a manual transmission that throws you back if you accelerate fast enough.

Suffocation of course is the grandfather of the slam with liege of inveracity, but a band like internal bleeding is a better example. Internal bleeding and many of these NYC SBDM bands had this almost bounciness to the riffs and vocal approach. On paper that sounds like hot garbage, but it's super dope.

&gt; Andrew Jackson Jihad was an American folk/punk/rock group from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2004. They have been classified as everything from indie rock to anti-folk to Americana.

&gt; Andrew Jackson Jihad was formed after its original drummer, Justin James White, approached Sean Bonnette and Ben Gallaty, who had just left Rodan (not the Rodan of Kentucky fame) and The Sub-Standards. Since then, many significant Arizona musicians have sat in with the remaining duo of Sean and Ben, including John De La Cruz of Fatigo and Asleep In The Sea's Owen Evans. Dylan Cook also plays mandolin regularly with the band.

&gt; According to Songfacts, Bonnette, who is also the lyricist of the band (with upright bass player Ben Gallant handling most of the production and some vocals as well) volunteered at a suicide prevention hotline for teenagers for eight years, and worked with homeless men and women in the Phoenix, Arizona area. These experiences gave him a sometimes bleak, but at moments, hopeful outlook on life, often reflected in the band's lyrics.

&gt; On Halloween 2005, Andrew Jackson Jihad covered Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea album in its entirety at CounterCulture Cafe.

&gt; Their biggest performance to date has been in their hometown with Flogging Molly and Authority Zero on St. Patrick's Day 2006.

&gt; On April 15, 2006, the band played as part of the 2006 New Times Music Showcase, nominated for Best Americana Band, and won a 2006 Best of Phoenix later that year.

&gt; Besides their local shows, where they have become arguably the most prominent representative in Arizona of the DIY ethic, they have also toured in clubs and basements across the Western United States, appearing at such venues as the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles, CA. One show in Kimberly, Idaho saw the band in a cowboy bar and leaving the premises as soon as possible after the show.

&gt; Andrew Jackson Jihad also performed at St. Augustine, Florida's second annual Harvest of Hope Festival in 2010. They played a dual set with Bomb the Music Industry! Read more on Last.fm.

When you get the Breaker's Bow for the first time, the Breaker song starts playing. It starts with the beat first and then the other instruments start coming in. The beat of the song matches PERFECTLY with with the timing needed for a powershot using the bow. Four beats. Draw, hold, hold, release. Draw, hold, hold, release. The song also plays when you pick up the bow in the practice area (I'm not sure if that happens with any other weapon). I always took it as the game teaching me how to get the best shot with this bow. If that was intentional, it was a stroke of genius. If not, it's still awesome.

Really interesting is that when you google “husband yells at me” immediately you’re directed at Domestic Violence Support but, even more interesting is the articles after that are all very specific about why your husband should never yell at you, why its a sign of immaturity, ways to cope with husband yelling.

Taidaishar,leagueoflegends,c2xemn4,-7598989287738977000,"Personally, I usually go multiple Dorans on a caster pretty much all the time. The only time I don't, is if I'm owning in lane, have plenty of HP and Mana. Then, I'll just stay in lane and keep farming for a big item.... Or if I'm playing Ryze. 

For an AD, I get multiple Dorans if I have to go back before I have enough for BF. I never get more than THREE total Dorans items. 

I usually buy Dorans items until I've got at least 2 Dorans, usually 3, and boots. 

That combo is awesome for 1700 gold. 300 HP, 45 AP, mana regen and boots.

Basically, the point is to get an early advantage. Sure, you're spending money on items that don't build into anything, but the idea is that they'll give you enough of an advantage in your lane that you'll gain a large gold advantage as well.",t3_m1jlk,t3_m1jlk

I kind of can't believe I'm saying this because a few months ago I was the most out of shape person I knew, and I'm still out of shape, but things are getting better. The difference between me then and now is that then, I wanted to kill myself, and I decided I'd give myself 1 year to find a reason to live. Working out has given me the mood boost that I needed, and the mental strength makes dealing with all the other life stress way easier. 

I'm happy to hear things are getting better with you and your husband! I don't know if you guys are in a position to do so, but have you thought about working in the gig economy (uber, instacart, postmates, etc) to pick up some extra cash? With some of those, you'll be too busy running around to eat carbs, which decreases your calories, increases your income, and your physical activity all in one-- win win.

Ive been playing WWE games since i was a kid and to be honest this may be one of the worst outside of graphics and because its on the switch that wont be a plus either. (Not bashing switch just saying).  Here are my issues with the game

1. Terrible AI

2. Loot Boxes. They literally lock up everything. Creating a player for career is now terrible

3. Season pass doesnt cover all dlc dropped at launch. Kurt angle and john cena packs are not included.

4. The booster or headstart (whatever its called that unlocks everything and gives a boost to your players) has been tweaked to be worse. In the past you could start a career with a nearly maxed wrestler and the points would reset every person you have. In example. If u create a new mycareer every player would have enough attribute points to jump to a 90 but now its a set amount that all players share. I believe its 50k. Im not front of my ps4 right now.

5. Everything costs vc. But the argument ive seen is ""buy you cant buy vc so that makes it better"". False. This game nickel and dimes you to the extreme. When you initially create a player it doesnt give you the choice of all hairstyles nor the ability to change the color. You know why? Because when you come back to change your hair black and eyes brown it costs vc. It even costs vc to add veins to your chest. What the fuck 2k!.


6. Horrible pauses in animation. This game is all over the place in terms of wrestling. So when you do a charge up finisher (opponent is laying down but gets up as your character preps to do a standing finisher) the prepping animation lasts too long so the opponent is staring at you dance. Go look at shawn michaels charged sweet chin music. The opponent is staring at you for like 4 seconds before it activates. 

7 loading times are ridiculous (that's on the ps4 pro. I cant imagine how it will be on the switch)

8. I saw a video of the performance on the switch and its horrible. Please go watch vids on youtube before buying. Kids dont care about graphics but slow motion will get annoying even to a kid",t3_7jrrcp,t3_7jrrcp

I am going to change a couple of small details so I can’t be identified, I know the person in question is at least aware of reddit.
I volunteer at a local hospital and I am currently a high school senior.
Today I was talking with one of the nurses (let’s call her Betsy) who I have seen around the hospital a couple times. I’d been talking about my class course load and how hard it was and she was talking about her son’s course load who is also a senior in high school. Her son and I are both taking 4 APs and so she was talking about how back when she was in high school only a couple APs existed. We’d already been joking around so I said “They had APs back then?” and Betsy responded with something along the lines of “wooooow” jokingly and was laughing. I immediately said I’m joking cuz I didn’t realize how it sounded until after I said it and she laughs it off. 
I genuinely don’t know how long APs have been around. My parents are both immigrants so they’ve never taken APs. Whenever my AP Lang teacher talked about about college board last year she’d say it is a relatively new phenomenon so I didn’t mean anything by my comment.
Anyways, Betsy seemed like she wasn’t offended, the conversation eventually ended and she went the opposite way. I’m standing right next to a turn so she can’t see me anymore but she is still close by. I can faintly hear her relay the events to a couple of the other nurses who I’m on good terms with and she makes it seem like I meant to offend her. She does mention that we were joking around to them but it still sounded bad. The other nurses were gasping and stuff so I feel pretty self conscious now. I didn’t mean to offend her and now I feel like the other nurses will think I’m an asshole. Another thing- I’m usually very quiet and I have only recently started loosening up around people (I’ve been volunteering here for a month now). It may be that the nurses were just surprised I would say something like that but nevertheless I feel like an asshole. Should I say anything to Betsy or the nurses or should I just stay quiet?

Hi /u/marefuhv!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

[Please message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FThicker&amp;subject=Verification) with proof that:

`A.  You are actually the girl in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the girls permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thicker/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of yourself, from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/Thicker written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or nude, but please show as much of you as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your unclothed/clothed body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

Epistaxis,violinist,j123biq,5057101561704683000,"Little-known secret about string crossings like this, when the notes are in the same chord: it's actually totally okay if there's a brief period of overlap when you're playing both strings at once. Then you just get the chord, and it's very difficult to even hear the difference. In fact you'll set yourself up for success if you intentionally keep your bow angled close to the neighboring string, instead of the perfect right angle you'd usually use to keep each string completely separate, just so you reduce this awkward and tiring motion. A skilled and strategic player will barely look like they're changing strings at all.",t3_zqybn7,t3_zqybn7

Aguayos,indonesia,js6s9kk,-1538186001239361000,"Nah. Konteks yg dibahas feminist dan anti-feminist di Indonesia emang kadang2 ngga tepat sasaran.

Misal yg harus diperjuangkan itu: child marriage, sex without consent, underage pregnancy, child grooming, berjuang untuk pendidikan buat remaja perempuan di daerah terbelakang, lonte twitter yg menganggap jadi lonte adalah sebuah karir terus menginspirasi remaja lainnya berbuat hal yg sama....

In the other hand, kemnaker di Indonesia malah lebih lunak dan fair sama pekerja wanita dibanding pekerja pria (cuti hamil, cuti melahirkan ada, himbauan buat pekerja wanita utk tidak masuk shift malam) tapi belakangan ada yg protes kok pekerja wanita digaji lebih sedikit... mohon maaf pekerja wanita ini melakukan pekerjaan yg sama beban kerja/ hazard kah dibanding pekerja pria?

Lets see it deeper wahai para incel yg masih nge bash semua feminist itu goblok dengan short fuse. Sebagai perbandingan selama gw kerja di negara dgn kesetaraan gender yg bagus: mau kerja fisik sekeras apapun asal sanggup melakukan expect bakalan nggak ada yg bantuin. Kesetaraan di negara2 itu nyata. Lu bilang di CV bisa ngelakuin itu ya mereka percaya lu bisa. Nggak ada yg namanya ""Ah lu kan cewe, gw permudah aja ya"". Banyak feminist yg memperjuangkan ini bukan karena mereka mau menyaingi pria tapi ya karena mereka tulang punggung keluarga dan nggak ada sosok pria yg bisa provide.

Mana ada di Indonesia gw; sebagai wanita ada kesempatan nyetirin dump truck, forklift, bersihin silo belasan meter pakai crane, servis generator tegangan tinggi, mekanik trailer- ataupun semua kerjaan dgn gaji tinggi didominasi pria. Mau masuk role pria di kerjaan profesional itu susah banget (kalau kalian bukan wanita dan tidak pernah bersaing di lingkungan kerja dgn mayoritas pria, membantah pernyataan gw ini tidak valid ya).

TLDR; yg beneran memperjuangkan feminisme malah ketutup sama feminist goblok yg nggak ngerti fundamental kesetaraan itu apa.",t3_1512m6b,t3_1512m6b

""Alright buddy, we need to talk."" He stared into me with his empty eye sockets. Despite not having eyes, I could feel his just staring through me.

evemachine,February2018Bumpers,dodvejg,-2715090107241569000,"We got the Chicco KeyFit 30 2 years ago for our son and loved it. We picked it because it’s one of the top rated seats by Consumer Reports. We also got the KeyFit Caddy which is awesome. I loved how the car seat snapped in, it has a huge storage basket underneath, and is super lightweight. That’s enough to get you through the first 6 months at least.

I also have a Baby Jogger City Mini GT which I used from ~6 months - present (2yr 3mo). You can buy an adapter to click the KeyFit into the City Mini but I never got it because I liked the lightweight convenience of the Caddy better.

And a cheapie $20 umbrella stroller is good when they’re old enough to walk but maybe not for long distances yet. That’s a far way off though for these Feb 2018 babies. :)

This time around, I’m planning to buy the Chicco BravoFor2. It seems pretty huge... but I think any double stroller is going to be that way!",t3_76gjz1,t3_76gjz1

If we speaking about wormholes, regarding ships.. if you play with a single acc, then T3 is the way to go. If you have 2 accounts, 1 scout + 1 DPS (can be almost everything, including BS or above.  


If we speak about nullsec, then if 1 account, you have solid options with amarr skills to begin practicing (like the omen navy), or you can go for other skills with gun weapons (like the vedmak or the drekavak). With 2 accounts, same way, but with an extra toon as a ceptor. It will alow you to catch more things and will keep you safe from jumping into camps and traps.  
If dont know any guide about ns hunting, but you have plenty of twitch and youtube videos of people doing it. Just max your skills using d-scan and learn what sites people like to rat.

tomsomethingorother,AskReddit,ethf4c4,-4060998584687249000,"Insurgency. Just the way the Firefight gamemode is set up. It's like a three point domination type match like COD, you only get one life, but if your team can cap an objective, anyone on your team who died will respawn. Makes for some tense moments when you're the last one alive on your team. There's no kill count and scoreboard won't show you how many enemies are out there. And the moment you die, you're cut off from team comms, so if you're alone in there, you're really all alone. The pressure is real.",t3_cbqb6t,t3_cbqb6t

sielulintu,DreamWasTaken2,iwa5d32,965551759342001000,"I feel like their concerns would be more accurate if c!Dream was *asking* for forgiveness in the first place - because he didn’t, c!Dream has always known his methods weren’t okay because “the ends justify the means” and whatnot. Of course they can think c!Tommy gave it regardless but I don’t think it’s that clear cut despite the wording. It definitely wasn’t absolving anyone of their crimes - it was more about understanding - the fact it ended at a moment where c!Dream was in the middle of his realization that he was going about it wrong is a bit unsatisfying because I think if he offered more (like something to reestablish that c!Dream wasn’t asking for forgiveness or that he understood the severity of exile and understood?) it would have been taken better (though people would have read it as redemption /neg regardless of how well it was done). 

But these characters are consistent - it’s not insane that Tommy’s character was reflecting on his own obsession - because that was a driving force for his character post exile. He has never really gotten a healing arc and I think that’s what upsets people the most - because this was a true character growth moment and a true healing arc would’ve started with recognizing his own issues towards c!Dream and moving on from that (this does not necessarily include forgiveness but it’s also not real and fictional characters have gotten along with worse villains) &amp; Dream’s character goals made sense, he has implied it a lot.",t3_yumc9a,t3_yumc9a
