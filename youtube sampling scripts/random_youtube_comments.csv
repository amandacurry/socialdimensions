On the other hand, the electricity that have to be transmitted through wires can provide a productive source of energy (stored in generators, light up houses, roads etc).

- areas with Low cost electricity are able to mine bitcoin
- they sell these bitcoin for higher price (large profit margin)
- the profits allow them to buy more resources than what the cheap electricity previously allowed

My qualm with this would then be: wont we be increasing total world electricity input? It still does not provide new utility, but rather it brings a huge upside to areas with cheap electricity (typically large land mass, cold areas).

Just because you use electricity to mine bitcoin doesn't mean that the bitcoin is now a transferable energy source.

He seems to think that mining bitcoin in cheap areas and using that money to subsidize expensive areas is the same as transporting the energy itself.

Subsidising energy just increases demand for energy, this using more fossil fuels.","3:40 ""You can move the (key word) value of the electricity magically without any of the problems of transportation"". 
Also, it's not so obvious that the electricity used by miners near volcanos for example would have been used in other ways.

So if there is a usage of electricity to mine Bitcoin, the transfer occurs when the wires heat up, the fans spin to cool the hard drives, and the screen glows.

If I could get a weapon for self defense that can non-lethally take down an attacker and have both range and precision, then I'd choose this for sure!

I don't get why people are acting like it's easy to take a life. Maybe they do gun down someone threatening their life, but it's still possible to get PTSD from such an act and have night terrors etc. Just because you weren't physically harmed, doesn't mean you're fine mentally or emotionally.","Also important is the fact that a firearm can rarely be used to defend yourself unless the level of threat matches the threshold requirement based in laws where you live. Many people are in prison because they use the gun and thought it would be legal to do so, and then they found out that it was not. There are many people in prison right now that use the gun to defend themselves or others, but were found guilty of a crime, because the courts did not agree that they should‚Äôve use a firearm. there are very few situations of violent conflict where you gun is considered appropriate. This is what makes the byrna platform so perfect because it looks scary but it‚Äôs not considered a firearm. Therefore you can use it for a multitude of conflict related situations. If a person that has a real gun is shot in their eyes or mouth facial area the byrna is highly effective and destructive.

X4YK-DEkvcw,"COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again.
The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome.
However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan‚Äôs ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA.
There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one.
If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour.
*(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)*
This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy‚Äôs plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE!
The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tatoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do.
When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance.
My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered!
The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul.
The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.

   Every time I hear this song and watch the video I‚Äôm amazed at how you are  consistently able to capture the feelings and emotions that encompass growing up, young love, and the human condition of wanting to be desired. Your music has been at the top of so many lists but still underrated in my opinion. From music video production to amazing songs that energize, make you want to dance, and sink deep into your soul it‚Äôs amazing what the Killers have become. I hope you understand how appreciative we all are of music you‚Äôve given us.  You‚Äôve captured the heartbeat of the middle class person and shined the spotlight on what is really important. Far be it for me to say but you guys are to this generation what Springsteen was to the 70s and 80‚Äôs. I‚Äôm not sure how the magic comes together when it comes to the Queen‚Äôs, The Tom Petty ‚Äòs, or the Dire Straights of the world .....perhaps the music was always there and it was just waiting for you guys to find it, but I‚Äôm certainly glad you did.

I didn't have a date for prom either. I grew older and I did change, and I look more handsome. I get a lot of girls' attention, but I just can't seem to push myself for it. I also go to a commuting college and it is often hard to find anybody to date. I have had a couple of girls notice me, but I guess I have been looking for that connection to actually get a girlfriend. Right now I feel like a total loser because school was getting hard and I was trying to date this girl, but she ignored me completely and I just had to cope with the fact of being alone for another winter break. Now I have two classes and I can't find a way out of my routine. That is me in the car, waiting for something badass to happen, a jolt of lightning to motivate me. I really hate driving now because it is the same shit, school or home. I am almost done with college and the greatest blessing of that is that I can finally move on with my life. I also started questioning my sexuality, but I just can't seem to find myself in a relationship with a guy.","I lost a lot of weight and the same thing happened where girls started showing me attention and it just felt weird, like you wouldn't have even seen me if I bumped into you 2 years ago.

A woman who is working her ass off and never gets a break until night, finally get that one night where she can rest. Or in this term, have fun for a change.

The possibility for them to meet again is minimal.
Yet they meet at the hotel she works at. He can se that she is both tired and sad of doing the same routine over and over again. He does something special for her, he takes her out on an unforgetable night. It might just have been this one night or maybe it lead to more, but one thing is for sure....She gets a good feeling inside her.

I'm doin it again I'm sorry, you guys really are great, good luck and God bless you and all ur family, God bless.","Hey bro, I don't know what happened and don't mean to give you any advice. I'm from Eastern Europe, grew up in NYC and family is also very important in our culture. There was a time for years that I thought they don't care and there's no going back or fixing it. Felt betrayed and cast out. Again, don't know your situation but in my case I played a massive role in that. Life is never that simple and they also played their part and made mistakes. But, eventually I realized it was my actions that were the catalyst for everything else that happened after. I had so much anger and resentment that at a time I truly believed that was it. It was a long journey, one that I'm still on, but today my family is in my life and I have their support and love. I'm grateful for it and don't take it for granted. I pray and hope that you can say the same one day. Again, I don't know your situation and unfortunately, sometimes there is no fixing it. Then again sometimes miracles do happen. I thought for sure there was no going back. There are still good people in the world and sometimes people that aren't blood will give you the love that family can't or won't at the time. I wish you all the best and will pray for you. ( I'm not a religious nut but I do believe in a creator and I do pray) there are places and people that you can reach out to when things get overwhelming. üí™üôè‚úäÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",2025-04-06T04:40:46Z,2025-04-08T03:26:57Z,The boss of Krispy Pizza makes a SPESH‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. üçïüíØ,22,Krispy Pizza,22,People & Blogs,trust,social_support,1,15,C_social_support,R_trust

He was in that tank for another year alone until i went to the store to see if i could get him some buddies.  I asked the guy there what i could put in with him that wouldnt hurt him.  Hed had a hard life and survived it all.  The guy at the fish place told me to get a female.  I said i thought they fought with each other and he basically said how do u think they mate duh?

-Bg3z-m7Zes,"Honest question with all due respect. Can one of the believers tell me what the appeal is of this religion. Like, why do you believe? What is compelling about it?","I would like to invite you to look into this dawa which the 12th imam is calling his ansar towards through his soul son Ahmad Al-Hassan and Abdullah Hashem ftip. We have named ourselves the ahmedi religion of piece and light. Because Islam has been hijacked by these none working scholars who also call themselves Muslims. And carrying this identity as a Muslim could confuse people to believe we are just another sect of Islam. 

We are calling the people towards the 7th and final covenant which god established with his messengers (Adam. Noah. Ibrahim. Musa. Isa. And Mohammed ftip). Today the 7th and final covenant is withheld by the 2 claimants of the Will of prophet mohammed fhip. Which are also the Two mahdis who are mentioned by name in the will of prophet mohammed fhip. 

So what is the value of this Will? 

‚Ä¢ The one who claims this matter, what is his proof?
‚Ä¢ he said: ‚ÄòHe is asked about the halal and haram'. He said, then Ali came and said: ‚ÄòThree proofs do not gather in a person except that he is the companion of this matter: That he be the most deserving [of the right] of the one who was before him, that he has the weapon, and that he be the owner of the apparent will'. (Al-KaÔ¨Å by Al-Kulaini, vol. 1, p. 284) 

Apparent means that it is something evident amongst the people, it is known and accepted and it is not something that somebody just came up with. 

And Imam Ahmed Al-Hassan (From Him is Peace) claimed to be ‚ÄúAhmed‚Äù in the will of Prophet¬†Mohammed¬†(PBUH¬†& His Family) and that he is the vicegerent of Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and his family). 

‚Ä¢ And Imam Al-Sadiq (From Him is Peace) said:¬†
‚ÄúThis is a matter that can not be claimed except by its companion, otherwise Allah would destroy the age of the one who falsely claims it‚Äù. (Al-KaÔ¨Å by Al-Kuleini volume 1 page 372) 

And we know that the Mahdi is the one who comes with the Will. 

‚Ä¢ And from it, from Moalla Ibn Mohammed, from Mohammed Ibn Jamhour, from Musa, from Al Hannan, from Al Hars Ibn Al Mugheira who said, 

‚ÄòI said to Abu Abdullah (PBUH), ‚ÄòBy what is the Master of this command recognised?‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòBy the tranquillity, and the dignity, and the knowledge, and the Will‚Äô‚Äô. - Basaair Al Darajaat ‚Äì P 10 Ch 13 H 2 

Thus, the divine Will is protected by God and He the Almighty will cut off the life of anyone who claims it falsely.¬†
Therefore, Ahmed Al-Hassan and Abdullah Aba Al-Sadiq both claimed the Will and are therefore the rightful companions of the Will. They are the successors whom we should hold tight to in this day and age‚Ä¶Peace and mercy is from them.


‚Ä¢ This matter will not be claimed except by the rightful owner, or else Allah will cut off his age.‚Äù - Al-Kafi, Al-Shaikh Al-Kulayni, Vol. 1, p. 373, Bihar Al-Anwar, Al-Allamah Al-Majlisi, Vol. 25, p. 112 

He also fits the description of the the name of the Mahdi in the books of the Sunni:
Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas‚Äôud: 

‚Ä¢ The Prophet (PBUH¬†& His Family) said: If only one day of this world remained. Allah would lengthen that day (according to the version of Za'idah), till He raised up in it a man who belongs to me or to my family whose father's name is the same as my father's, who will fill the earth with equity and justice as it has been filled with oppression and tyranny. - Sunan Abi Dawud, Abi Dawud, Book of The Promised Deliverer, Hadith No. 4282 

One of the names of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH¬†& His Family) was ‚ÄúAbdullah.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ On the authority of Abu Dawood, who heard from Prophet Mohammad (PBUH¬†& His Family) saying: 

""I am Abdullah whose name is Ahmad.‚Äù - Bihar Al-Anwar, Al-Allamah Al-Majlisi, Vol. 24, p. 397; Tafsir Al-Ayashi, Mohammed ibn Masoud Al-Ayashi, Vol. 1, p. 44. 

So where is this Will of prophet Muhammad which mentioned Ahmad and Abdullah? 

‚Ä¢ O Ali, there will be twelve Imams after me and after them there will be twelve Mahdis. So you, O Ali, are the first of the twelve Imams, Allah The Exalted has named you in His heavens Ali Al-Mortadha (Ali the Content), Amirul Mo‚Äômineen (the Commander of the Believers), Al-Siddiq Al-Akbar (the Greater Truthful), Al-Farouq Al-A‚Äôtham (the Greater Judge and Differentiator between truth and falsehood), Al-Ma‚Äômoun (the Trusted), and the Mahdi (the Rightly Guided). These names may not be attributed to other than you. O Ali, you are my Vicegerent/Guardian on my own family, their living and their dead, and upon my women: Whomever I kept, she shall find me tomorrow, and whomever I divorced, I am innocent of her, I will not see her and she will not see me on the Day of Resurrection. And you are my Successor (Khalifa) on my nation after me. If death comes to you, hand it over to my son Al-Hassan, the Righteous and Benevolent. Then if death comes to him, let him hand it over to my son Al-Hussein, the Martyr, the Pure and Murdered. If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, the Master of Worshippers, Dhul Thafant (the one with hard skin on his knees) Ali. If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Mohammed Al-Baqir (the Revealer of Knowledge). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Ja‚Äôfar Al-Sadiq (the Truthful). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Musa Al-Kadhim (the Patient). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Ali Al-Ridha. If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Mohammed Al-Thiqa Al-Taqqi (the Trustworthy, the God-Fearing). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Ali Al-Nasih (the Advisor). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Al-Hassan Al-Fadhil (the Meritorious). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Mohammed the Safeguarded of the Family of Mohammed, peace be upon them. Those are the twelve Imams. Then there will be twelve Mahdis after him, so if death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, the first of the close ones, he has three names, one like mine and my father‚Äôs and it is Abdullah (Servant of God), and Ahmed (the Praised), and the third name is Al-Mahdi (the Guided) and he is the first of the believers.‚Äù

_-UWrw-rhsc,"Putting a camera in the fridge, especially a standard, non-specialized camera, can lead to a few issues and the video you'd capture would mostly be of the fridge's interior and its contents.
Here's what would likely happen and what kind of video you'd get:
What would happen to the camera:
 * Battery drain: Cold temperatures significantly reduce battery efficiency. Your camera's battery would drain much faster than usual.
 * Condensation: This is the biggest risk. When you take the camera out of the cold fridge and into a warmer room, condensation can form inside the camera and on the lens. This can lead to:
   * Fogged lens/screen: Your images and screen would become blurry or obscured.
   * Internal damage: Moisture inside the camera can damage sensitive electronics, leading to malfunctions or permanent failure.
 * LCD sluggishness: LCD screens can become slow and unresponsive in the cold, making it difficult to review footage or adjust settings.
 * Stiffened parts: Lubricants in lenses and camera mechanisms can stiffen, potentially affecting autofocus and other moving parts.
 * Brittle materials: Extreme cold can make plastic parts more brittle, increasing the risk of cracks or breakage if the camera is bumped.
What kind of video you would capture:
Assuming the camera survives and functions, you would likely capture:
 * The inside of your fridge: This would include all your food items, drinks, shelves, and maybe the back wall of the fridge.
 * Light changes: When the fridge door opens, you'd see a sudden influx of light, followed by darkness when it closes.
 * Hands and faces: You'd likely see people's hands reaching for items, and perhaps glimpses of their faces as they open the door.
 * Movement of food: As items are taken out or put in, you'd capture the movement of the food.
 * Condensation forming: If the camera is left in for a while and then taken out, you might actually capture the lens fogging up as condensation forms.
 * Temperature changes: If the camera has a temperature display or a way to show internal conditions, you might see the temperature drop and then rise.
Practical Applications (with specialized cameras):
It's worth noting that there are specialized ""smart fridge cameras"" designed for this purpose. These are often small, battery-powered devices that take pictures every time the fridge door is closed and send them to an app. Their purpose is to help users keep track of groceries, create shopping lists, and reduce food waste. These cameras are built to withstand the fridge environment.
In summary, putting a regular camera in the fridge is not recommended due to the risk of damage, but if it did work, you'd essentially get a time-lapse or real-time view of your fridge's internal activity.",well don‚Äôt worry I only left it in there for about three seconds!,2025-05-17T14:59:20Z,2025-05-17T15:01:49Z,does this trend work? #blowup #fridge #trend #viralvideo #subscribe #subscribe #flash #disco #colors,22,nattycakes,22,People & Blogs,respect,power,5,11,C_power,R_respect

E8zj-jtNh6U,"I dare you - actually, I implore you - to talk reasonably to a queer person about why they feel negatively about the church and why ""woke moralism/leftist religion/Gender ideology"" is actually comforting, cathartic, and has arguably become more Christ-like than the entire lede and mission statement of your channel. Don't come in with any hopes of conversion - do not have that be a primary, secondary, or tertiary reason. I want you to talk seriously about them. I want you to look face-to-face with a trans person who's lost their friend to a suicide attempt and seriously posit to them that their brain is so jumbled and mushy they're just more susceptible to suicide. You're not going to sound like you're bringing forth tough love or grace or anything like that - you're telling them on some level that they don't deserve joy, happiness, contentment, any of our inalienable rights over the fact they have different identities than you.

Like Belief It or Not, you are not handling any of your trauma well at all. You've doubled down on conservative ideology because it feels soothing. There is a part of you that sobs inconsolably like Dr. Frederick Frankenstein when his creation doesn't immediately wake up - when you hear a Black person tell people to look around and argue that the things we said we eradicated in the 1960s are still floating around in radically divergent ways or when queer people openly engage in confusing and transgressive subcultures because you stubbornly won't let them have the white picket fence or when women talk about the injustices committed upon them by church bodies. You're in a scary world, yes, but please grow up. You're acting un-Christlike. You're acting more like an Antichrist to be honest. You just wish all your problems could go away, Nicolae.

Please be better.","Nothing is more Anti-Christ-like than condoning, indulging, and supporting a person's every negative emotion and fault. There is nothing more comforting or cathartic than sin. That's what makes it so tempting. Who are you to take away an alcoholic's bottle, when it brings him so much joy and pleasure? When Jesus befriended the outcasts, downtrodden, and prostitutes, it wasn't because he approved of their behaviour, it was to minister to them. The healthy don't need doctors, the sick do. His love wasn't to condone them, but to improve them.

Getting that white picket fence has been getting easier and easier for gay people every year for a long time now, but if anything, the percentage of gay people actively shunning a conventional lifestyle and participating in ""transgressive subcultures"" has only exploded in that same period of time. It's almost as if people who identify as *queer* don't want to have a *conventional* lifestyle. The LGBT movement was super concerned with proving to heterosexual people that they were just as normal as straight people until the majority of people started to agree with them.
Now they seem out to prove the exact opposite. Now the gay people who want that white picket fence are shunned as ""homonormative"" Uncle Tom integrationists by queer activists. Hell, I've seen people in the LGBT movement who sincerely believe that getting gay marriage was BAD for gay people because it made them more likely to live content homonormative lives outside of any transgressive or revolutionary subcultures.

Also, RZ is a Calvinist. He believes that EVERYONE is naturally depraved and inclined to sin (even himself), NO ONE (even himself) actually DESERVES Heaven and EVERYONE (even himself) is a sinner who DESERVES Hell, and everyone who receives Heaven only does so because of their faith in God's grace. The damned are getting what they deserve, and the sanctified are getting better than they deserve, thanks to Jesus being punished in their place.

That trans person's friend who committed suicide? Sinner. Heck, suicide is one of the Top Ten No-Nos.

I understand why this might not be very comforting. It's not. But it's not supposed to be. It is demanding. It asks you to be better than you are. It asks you to be better than you can be. But it also forgives you when, not if, you're not. Calvinists also believe that those God elects to save WILL be saved, once and forever. RZ has faith that his eternal salvation is out of his sinful and depraved hands, but in the hands of Jesus.

E8zj-jtNh6U,"Ok, so a couple of things (keep in mind that English is my 3rd language and I cannot be bothered enough to check every grammatical mistake):
You claim that the modern scientific principals were started by the Christians during the Enlightnment and whilst it is partially true you are completely forgetting the philosophers and scientists from ancient Greece and Rome such as Thucydides, a famous historian, known from his exceptional method of writing about the past events or legacy of the pagan roman jurist that layed fundation of our western lawmaking. The former has never ever heard of Christ and the latter most likely view Christianity as a Jewish sect that proved to be dangerous for the Empire. It is important since you've again and again refer to history as a branch of science to boost your claim about it's importance during the ages. And no one that I know is denying that. Christianity certainly had it's place in the history of Europe but that does not prove it's teachings right. Just because some Universities were started by Christians does provide any evidence for its absolute claims. (Also not to mention the Chinease and the Indians and the lost cultures of the Americas which too had their share in history of science)
Now to the second point: ""Leftism is a religion"". Unless you provide an further explanation this is simply false. People that call themselves leftleaning, as you've rightly stated, don't go to church. They don't worship a supernatural diety, they don't pray, there are no sacraments, there are no religious mysteries of any kind, they don't even subscribe to a particular worldview. If one were to follow your reasoning any 'subcultre' can be called a religion such as goths or skaters. And this I just find dubious. Also to call Karl Marx the inventor of modern progressivism is deeply misunderstanding history and misreading the current situation. Most people who are now calling themselves leftleaning never even have read his works. They don't want to distribute the means of production. They don't want to unify the society into one unanimous class. Instead of that they mainly focus on minority rights within the state and climate, whilst other social issues are also present. But you can hardly call those inspired by Marx. Moreover, what you now refer to as a subjective reality and then link it with postmodernism / marxism, also has its roots in antiquity. Check out the famous sophists from the classical era of ancient Greece, and you will see that this whole ""reality is not objective, we can never know anything for sure"" is a statement of a certain sophist named Pyrrho. If this is the case, why not call people on the left Pyrrhonist? Well, the reason is simple: no one knows who he is, so one cannot automatically set your mind for or against such a person. However this is clearly working with Marx since he is with one accord connected by the populus with communism.
Now to the third point: Leftism like a virus and historical figures. Well due to increase in historical knowledge we now are aware that some of our founding fathers were not ideal men. And describing their actions, morally deeply flawed from our perspective, is simply telling the truth. Since it is true to say that Founding Fathers for example didn't want for women (or in reality most of the population) to have the right to vote. Is it then OK to demolish their statues? Well, I don't know. But it is the historical truth that needs to be advocated, and we should definetely not create some wizzard myth man from the past. It is an insult to science. We should keep a clear head, not be anachronistic and try to understand their behaviour whilst keeping in mind that history as a whole is pretty much disasterous. For your argument in a debate to rely strictly on history is sadly in reality a fallacy. Btw great job with dehumanasine people you don't agree with by calling their believes a virus. A virus I should add that one has to defend against. 
Left cannot create institutions: this is simply false. For example there are many secular charities that were started by people with leftleaning world view, to name a few that originate from or oparate in my country: PAH (Polska Akcja Humanitarna), WO≈öP (Wielka Orkiestra ≈öwiatecznej Pomocy), DKMS (Fundacja na rzecz nowotwor√≥w krwi), Otwarte Klatki and so on. 
Your gender is determined by your chromosomes. Well I guess you have never heard about combinations such as XXY or XYY, gender dysphoria, being born with both female and male reproductive organs, having hormonal hyper- hypoproductivity and so on. To say that gender is entirely depended on chromosomes is the same as to disregard those. Not to mention mental issues that are crucial for understanding that our conciousness (whatever it might be) is located in our brain. Quick proof of that: if someone has a tumor inside their brain, they behaviour changes according to the specific location of the additional cell mass. Now knowing that we are we bacause of our brains, if someone really feels or rather knows it that inside they are different gender, how do you know that they are wrong? 
Now quick story from me. Since in other videos you've explained your story and how you became a devoted Christian, I would like to share my perspective. I grew up and still live in Poland, were Catholicism is a dominant faith. Here being religious is considered normal, especially in smaller communities. Here you can be spit on or be beaten up because you are holding hands with your partner who is of the same sex. Again it is not the worst, there are countries in which one will be inprisioned or be executed for that. And what is funny people who believe in such methods will also tell you that there is one objective reality, one objective truth and that they are on the right side of it. Everyone else is a dangere to the survival of society. I was raised as an catholic, I was even an altar boy. But later in my life I started to question the authority of the Church and the Bible itself. People laughed at me but doubts were everywhere, since I couldn't reconcile my believes and the catholic doctire. Well eventually I saw more and more contraditions, even in the text itself and finally I left the Church. To even see for myself, I have learned both Latin and Ancient Greek. Long story short, now after nearly fifteen years I am a happy man that lives his life trying not to harm anyone.
Don't be fooled by anyone who is telling you he holds the absolute truth, it usually doesn't end well.","Holy fuck, this comment was absolutely lovely to read through. The argumentation was well built and addressed most of the issues i had with the video, not to mention Christian conservatives in general. On top of that it corrected many of the inaccuracies peddled by the idea that ‚ÄúChristians were the drivers of science‚Äù which while having some truth is wildly misleading, as shown by your Ancient Greek examples. And your points about gender were extremely on point and underlined using scientific and empirical evidence ( ‚Äúobjective information‚Äù as conservatives love to say) why many outdated views on the matter don‚Äôt hold any merit. Thanks for making my day :)",2023-03-24T22:42:26Z,2023-03-26T11:29:58Z,KingdomCraft: The Leftist mind,22,Redeemed Zoomer,22,People & Blogs,respect,knowledge,3,11,C_knowledge,R_respect
E8zj-jtNh6U,"What the left are worshipping is lust. Their ultimate goal is to achieve as much stimulation as possible. While christians try to get rid of lust and try to find salvation in faith alone ""For no water of this earth will quilt our thirst"". It's 2 approaches to the same problem. A existence that without any additional information is meaningless. A rat race with no finish line. Be born just to die. Christians find purpose in faith. Christians beliefe that we were made by God. Christians belief that nothing in this world matters. Christians belief that if we want salvation we can accept the gift of our creator by rejecting every earthly pleasure and thus gaining salvation in god's love alone. Leftist believe that life is meaningless. Leftists belief we exists because we exist there is no reason why we exist. Leftist belief our existence is random. Even thinking about determinismism leftist think that humans have no purpose or reason to exist. And because there is no awnser for existence from a leftist world view there is something leftists can believe that is proven real to them and that is pleasure. Leftist gain pleasure from eating and sex and other lustful aktivities. True leftists solely devote their life to get as much pleasure as possible. Leftists thus pray to gain more pleasure. True leftists only care about others because of egoistic altruism. They believe it's the way to maximize pleasure. The question now is why would one choose one over the other. One trys to maximize pleasure in life. And the other trys to maximize pleasure after life. One has the benefit of definitiv proof you can check your self but the trade of of only having a life that will end. The other one has the benefit of immortality and salvation after life but you won't be able to definitivly proof god's existence like you can proof the existence of pleasure it is more nuanced.

The choice is ultimatatly explained. 
It's the choice between good and evil. 
Between God and then devil. 
Leftists are satanists in essence. 
Leftists are egoists. 
While Christians are Altruists
Christians are Christians. 

With that knowledge we know angels who recieved all the knowledge still some decided for and some against god. 
God gives us the choice he neither wants to force nor deny us. 
God's punishment to those who don't accept his gift is being denied his gift of salvation. 
And without the gift of salvation you either won't get salvation or have to find it yourself.

Leftists believe salvation is found in pleasure. 

So if one wants to decide between Leftism and Christiannity there is 1 simple question.

Do you believe you can find salvation if pleasure or in faith. 

Currently no of those have absolutly definitive proof. 
While Christians will claim there is 100% truth.
So will Leftists Claim.
For example there is a surgery that can implant an electrode into your brain stimulating your pleasure center 24/7 at full blast killing you slowly cause you lose the will to life since there is nothing to life for anymore because your purpose was to maximize pleasure. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de_b7k9kQp0

So a Christians goal is to however possible stimulate that brain area the littlest as he can exept if it is through pleasuring other people.
Thats why Jesus wore rags and sandels. He didn't treat himself through anything exept through helping others. 
God didn't only become flesh. Jesus is Altruism. 
Anytime a Christians does something good it is through the holy spirit.
God is good.
Altruism is good.
Jesus is God

So the decision is ultimatly yours. It's like picking a class in a Video game. Each one has trade offs. At first glance it's hard to see which one is the best. Do i pick the mage or the troll. 
At the end it is up to speculation and experience to know who has the more overpowered buff or to know the one that has been nerfed and is worse. If everyone decided to be with god it would not be a free decision.","So yeah if you are a christians to get neightynine point nine period as close to god remove the Nucleus accumbens. And if you leftists if you want to become neightynine point nine period pleasured put a eletrode into the Nucleus accumbens that stimulates it 24/7. And yes you will die within the period no one else is keeping you alive. Because you won't be keeping yourself alive. You will stop drinking and eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-0KfwFCMRM

What it comes down to is that the human brain is designed to get so much pleasure. Each time you choose to sin you spend pleasure. 
joy is a currency. You can decide what to spend it on but if you are a human you will spend it or you will die. 
If you spend it all you will die.",2023-03-24T21:17:17Z,2023-03-24T21:35:16Z,KingdomCraft: The Leftist mind,22,Redeemed Zoomer,22,People & Blogs,knowledge,conflict,0,12,C_conflict,R_knowledge
E8zj-jtNh6U,"as a leftist, i've been watching and thinking a lot about religion lately. i think a lot of the opinions religious people hold about leftists and atheists specifically are based on this idea that religion is an innate human quality, rather than a set of beliefs one holds about the nature of the world. therefore, if you ""don't believe in a god"" (which translates to ""isn't a part of my religion"" for most), then you must consider yourself god, because no one can exist without considering *something* god, in their eyes. i do consider it a form of cognitive dissonance, as it's rejecting the idea that anyone, even atheists, simply don't believe in anything being god. i'd be willing to discuss more if you're willing to at least listen, but i doubt i'd be able to change your mind, especially since you're a former leftist. i'm pretty much the opposite of you ideologically- raised christian conservative, slowly became leftist","Religion is mostly based on a set of morals that has been formed for us, which sounds simple, but it has influenced us in many more ways than you think. Charity to the homeless for example, basic human rights, and I see this being ignored by many, but Christianity was the religion in the early Middle Ages that outlawed slavery. For the most part most Christians don't consider the argument ""if you don't believe in God yourself to be God"", and I haven't heard of the argument for the most part. In the case of why we believe in God, it's quite simple, if the universe was able to be created by a few atoms colliding, and the rules of the universe were created by atoms colliding, why is everything not going to mayhem with millions of atoms. More so, the universe is constantly expanding, so why isn't there a new set of rules made for the entire universe for every inch of the universe created? If nothing can make a large set of rules, then something should be able to create infinitely more rules to the universe, that is usually the overarching problem with not believing in a God.",2023-03-24T14:13:51Z,2023-04-21T03:09:37Z,KingdomCraft: The Leftist mind,22,Redeemed Zoomer,22,People & Blogs,similarity,conflict,0,14,C_conflict,R_similarity

E8zj-jtNh6U,"As a current liberal, I figured I'd mention a point that I feel is important to, although much of the video isn't something I can deeply comment on given that we share fundamentally different mindsets. (Btw, this is indeed an attempt to persuade readers towards my philosophy, much like this video is a work to further persuade those towards your beliefs; it's a fundamental requirement for any meaningful discussion of a topic) The one thing I can certainly comment on is how the video mentions that Male and Female are clear-cut, scientific classifications, proven by chromosomes. This premise isn't actually true, for instance there are a number of genetic disorders that can create patterns other than XX and XY, such as Turner Syndrome (Only one X chromosome) or Klinefelter syndrome (Two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome). In addition, only a few genes on those chromosomes determine sexual development, so due to crossing over, (the natural occurrence where pieces of similar chromosomes are exchanged in cell division: keep in mind this is an extremely oversimplified definition) people born and considered by basically everyone (including devout Christians) a certain gender can turn out to have X and Y chromosomes not corresponding to that gender. Even ignoring chromosomes entirely, and just focusing on reproductive organs (you know, the ones I can't mention if I want this comment to stay up), the presence of people born intersex (possessing both or neither male and female reproductive organs) disproves the notion that there is a simple divide between Male and Female, and that those are the only two human developments possible. With my current attempt at debate concluded, I am genuinely curious to see what argument others might make in order to convince me otherwise (by the way, I apologize for the username, for once I'm trying to actually do something important with this account).

I will say, you did manage to convince me that the debate over Gender Identity is one fundementally based on Religion; while I personally don't think in terms of how you outlined in the video, it's easy and reasonable to see arguments towards the common adoption and respect of gender identity being based in faith.",Can i now identify as a dragon?

This procedure (steps 1. through 5.) is to be used for both the black and chrome logo key fob. This will program the fob to Start/stop engine while it is inserted into the key port. All new fobs should be programmed for this regardless of logo or SKS functionality
-------------------
1. Get into the car, close and unlock all doors and ensure the car is off
2. Insert old fob (your fob that currently works) into slot and remove it 4 times in a row, and insert it a fifth time but leave it in there!
2. Open and close driver door 6 times.
3. Remove old fob from slot. Car is in fob programming mode at this point. Red anti-theft light remains on.
4. Insert new fob and leave in the slot. Watch the blinking red anti-theft light on the dashboard. When it stops flashing and goes dark (after 40 seconds or so), your new fob is all set.
5. Remove the new fob and you're done with the START/STOP portion of programming ( if you have SKS, proceed to PROCEDURE B don't have SKS, proceed to PROCEDURE C).

PROCEDURE B
This procedure (steps 1. through 10.) is for chrome logo key fobs and vehicles with SKS (Smart Key System) functionality: Lock/unlock doors remotely + SMART KEY functionality
--------------------
1. Open the driver door and leave it open with no fob in slot (ensure the driver door is unlocked). Other doors can be locked or unlocked, it doesn't matter.
Complete step 2 within 5 seconds
2. Insert old fob into slot and remove it twice.
Complete steps 3. and 4. within 40 seconds of completing step 2.

3. Close and open driver door twice.¬†
4. Insert and remove old fob once.
Complete steps 5., 6., 7. and 8. within 40 seconds of completing step 4.
5. Close and open driver door twice again.¬†
6. Insert old fob in slot and close door.
7. Without pressing the brake, press power button, wait a second, press it again, wait a second, press it a third time to turn car back off.
8. Remove old fob from slot. You'll be in ""add mode"" at this point. Within 3 seconds, the car should lock and unlock doors to verify it is in add mode. (the precise number of times the car locks/unlocks the door is model specific - but it should do it at least once). If it does not cycle the locks, return to step 1. otherwise proceed to step 9.

Steps 9.a. and 9.b. should be started within 40 seconds of completing step 8.
9a: Press and hold the Lock and Unlock key (simultaneously) on the OLD/MASTER fob. (a couple of seconds should pass and the locks will cycle once. If you do not get this cycle, it is likely due to a weak CR 2032 battery in your fob. Replace the battery in your old fob and try again).¬†
9b: Press both the Lock and Unlock key (simultaneously) on the NEW fob. Hold for about 1.5 seconds (several users have reported it being necessary to execute this step twice, if your first go around does not indicate success, try it again and execute this step twice. Please post what worked in the comments below).
9c: Within three seconds, press the lock key on the NEW fob. If successful the lock/unlock will cycle once indicating success (It may take a while for the lock/unlock cycle. I've seen it happen just as I was ready to say, ""well, it didn't work"". If you wait for a long time (a long time being more than a minute) and get no cycle at all, complete step 10. and test to see if the SKS functions of your new fob work. If they do, pls report that on this thread).¬†
9d. - If you need or want to program another ""new"" fob, repeat steps 9. a. 9.b. and 9.c. for the next new fob. If done programming fobs, proceed to step 10.
10. To end this programming, open then close the driver's door or put the fob in the slot.

Unfortunately, I have no idea what PROCEDURE C is. If you've got SKS though, you don't need it. Otherwise, you can probably find it elsewhere on the web.

Hope that helps!","It might be that the car computer reached the limit of keys, or frequencies, that could be programmed in its computer AND after you programmed the second NEW keyfob you bought, it displaced, pushed out, or erased, the old key, or frequency. Once I lost my key with built in remote buttons from a 2001 Lexus. I called a mobile locksmith and paid nearly $400 for 2 new chipped keys, he programmed them into the cars computer, I asked him not to erase the lost key's frequency, in case I later find my original key. I did find my key, about a week later, and it would no longer start my car. I am not sure if the car's computer could not store more than 2 key/chip frequencies, or the locksmith just did whatever the hell he pleased and erased my old key from the car's computer!!",2017-10-06T17:06:36Z,2019-08-14T01:25:06Z,Gen2 Prius Smart Key Repair (transferring key electronics to new key shell),1,calvo9,1,Film & Animation,similarity,conflict,0,14,C_conflict,R_similarity

4CUV-WDDKOM,"As a quite new vinyl collector, my reasons are (not in any particular order):
1) The cool artwork, especially gatefolds.
2) Sound quality. I collect mainly 70s and 80s records, a period that in my opinion was superior in mastering quality compared to most newer releases.
3) My older relatives are really nostalgic / delighted to hear some music from the past. It's nice to bring some joy to other peoples' lives. Most of this music is unavailable otherwise.
4) Vinyl wears down a little bit every time you play it, which makes you appreciate it more in a sense of ""the next time it will sound worse"".
5) The concept of owning a physical copy of something. Almost feels like I own the ""original master tape"" of a record, when compared to mp3 versions that other people listen.
6) Ever heard of CD rot? Doesn't effect vinyl.
7) I don't think vinyl is disappearing any time soon. I will probably even make a small profit from my records should I ever decide to sell them (I normally buy whole crates of used records at once for huge discount).
8) You can tinker with the sound by swapping cartridges and adjusting the tracking force. Makes the whole listening experience more involving with cleaning the records, removing static and so on.
9) Used records have a certain cozy feel to them. For example, some might have written notes about the record being a present of some sort, some might have a distinguishable scent of aftershave etc etc.

Only two cons that I have:
1) If you order the used records online, you can only trust the seller's word on the condition. Most of the time I've been disappointed.
2) There is sometimes no visible signs of a bad sounding record. It can be ruined by being formerly played on trashed needle or it can sound bad even unplayed (some near mint early 60s records I have got bad crackling to them)",On your point about vinyl wearing down and sounds worse each time you play it. That's not a good thing because it's not forever lasting. Also CD rot only affects CDs stored in cold damp places. I've got CD albums that are 32 years old and they are in pristine perfect condition and they will go on being that way forever because I look after them. The only times I've experienced CD Rot are when I've bought CDs either second hand or off online stores but this was only twice in about 300 hundred purchases.,2015-05-15T02:21:13Z,2015-12-21T04:02:35Z,Why do people collect Vinyl,22,Francis,22,People & Blogs,respect,conflict,0,11,C_conflict,R_respect

4CUV-WDDKOM,"I just find most main stream music is being mastered with a ton of compression (soundwave compression, not file compression)¬†and gain added making for a louder file.Basically¬† an ipod mastering. Vinyl doesn't have the same dynamic range and cannot be mastered the same way. Just try using an audio editer and have a look at the soundwave of a cd or digital file¬†on a graph.It will look like a fat wall of sound reaching near 0db.¬†",Exactly and this is one of the reasons why people believe vinyl sounds better than CD. But CD has a flat frequency response from 20HZ to 20KHz and a much greater dynamic range and adds no audible noise or distortion to the signal. When the recording and mastering is done well a CD is absolutely superior to  even the best vinyl in every way. Vinyl has so many physical problems that affect the sound in a negative way from compromising the sound quality for cutting the laqurer to production and pressing the copies and then the playback equipment at the end.

Mother was fully indian.

Kamala born in US and was registered by her parents as Caucasian.

She study in a black student mostly college. 

Then once she got into politcs and started romance with willie brown.

Then she has been switching to indian to black whenever is beneficial to her.

Oh remember she was listening tupac and snoop and smoking joing even when both artists were not pulled their debut albums yet.

So by simple math father 50% black mother 100% Indian

Kamala would be 50% indian and barely 25% black.

sQOG-dBsgzQ,I love the statement They have been doing it for so long that they have forgotten why they started in the first place. That is so true of many of our farming practices today unfortunately. This is an outstanding channel to get back some of our lost or nearly forgotten techniques.,"There used to be much fewer people. The old technique was more productive during some period, where there were not enough people to¬†watch over vast farming area at early stages of the rice paddy. The dynamism changed now with farmable land is decreasing fast, while population rising at alarming rate. Blindly applying those techniques is counter productive now, since you have less plants, and cost for fertilizer, weed, pest control chemical would eat into the profit, yet this old inorganic method doesn't promote natural growth of the rice paddy plant.

When exploring new terrain, to turn an established field with other weeds into rice paddy ready, the fastest way to wipe them out is to flood the whole field and drowned them. Rice plant survives the flooding and take over. You can't just randomly throw seeds into flooding water, so in turn you have to terminate seeds, and transplant once it!s sprouting. This method is shorter-ism since it relies on previously good soil. The more you flood the soil, the more you change the local eco system. This land later become wetland which brings new pest, and invasive weeds.

 Mr.Masanobu Fukuoka method is not one solution for all problem, but its time is now in this cycle. We need our farming land back. We have enough people to share the responsibility to responsibly take care of the land, the soil and our food.",2011-04-07T19:39:26Z,2022-02-26T07:49:46Z,Masanobu Fukuoka rice and orchard techniques,28,paul wheaton,28,Science & Technology,knowledge,social_support,1,12,C_social_support,R_knowledge

X7J3-4mC6ws,"My K 1200 LT, with this basic design Engine, if I parked it on the side stand, and returned shortly after parking. When I started the machine, it poured smoke out the exhaust like a Kawasaki 500 / 2 stroke tripple..
  I complained to my dealer about it. He said that‚Äôs normal.
  If the clutch slave cylinder leaked onto the clutch. which was not uncommon, the slave cylinder, and the clutch, had to be replaced‚Ä¶ an acquaintance of mine was a mechanic at a BMW motorcycle shop‚Ä¶ that is when I found this out and I was very interested because at the time I had The same machine that was being operated on on the mechanics bench.
  it was 2010. he had the rear wheel, the bodywork, the trunk, the seats, the rear frame section, the swingarm, the transmission, and who knows what else removed when he called me over to take a look at what my bike looks like in the work required to change the clutch.. I asked him what a job like this costs..
  he paused as he looked at me for my reaction. He said approximately $4500, Plus parts,plus disposal fee, Plus shop materials, Plus tax.
that was in 2010, 2010 prices‚Ä¶
  I have had dozens of bikes over the past five decades. Venture‚Äôs, goldwings, Sport bikes, commuters, dual sports, dirt bikes, trails bikes, road racing machines, lots of makes.. gas gas, beta,fantic, moto guzzi, Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, Bridgestone, and one BMW..
  108 so far.
  The most disappointing motorcycle I ever owned was the BMW K 1200 LT. It had the second best seat I ever owned, the motor made adequate power, nice widely spaced transmission complemented the broad torque power band of the engine. I loved the heated seat and grips.. it had a great headlight. The cruise control was among the best i have had.. my wife loved the heated seat and heated back rest. reverse came in handy.
BUT:::
 I was looking for a remote campground where my friends were camping‚Ä¶ I got a little lost, and I had to turn around. I ended up going down a fairly steep paved road covered with fly ash/cinders. no problem, I‚Äôve had decades of off-road riding experience on slippery surfaces‚Ä¶I tapped the brakes going down that fairly steep hill covered with cinders, and I wasn‚Äôt ready for this, I had no brakes at all..Nothing. I pumped the brakes, nothing front or rear. That was my first experience with ABS brakes on slippery surface‚Äôs..The motorcycle ABS computer detected slippage, so it shut the brakes off. I suppose ABS really stands for, all braking stops.. so there I was going down the slope of a road in the middle of nowhere with no brakes on a 900 pound motorcycle. There was a 90¬∞ turn coming up at the bottom of this hill. Luckily, about 20 feet off the road there was an 8 foot high cyclone fence around some type of auto salvage business.. I went straight off the road through the grass and into the fence with my front wheel. The only damage I had was a broken front fender..
  after I replaced the fender, I decided change the brake fluid and the clutch fluid. I used to be a motorcycle mechanic and several different dealerships, no big deal to change brake fluid and clutch fluid.. actually it is a big deal with a BMW. I did research on the Internet, and people on blogs said, don‚Äôt even attempt to try this job yourself because, if you get air in the system, the system will detect that and shut down completely front and back wheel.. he will then have to trailer the bike to the dealer to have the dealer plug the machine into its diagnostics terminal to reset the ABS after they bleed the brakes.
  I didn‚Äôt believe that, so I bought the plastic vessel for holding more brake fluid that attaches to the reservoir for the brake fluid. Because the brakes on this machine were electric, hydraulic. The key must be on to activate the servo pump, to pass the brake fluid through the system‚Ä¶ The reservoir is so tiny and the servo will suck that brake fluid out of there so fast, that you will get air in the system if you‚Äôre not careful. And when that happens, you are screwed.
  I called the dealer and asked how much it would be to have my brake fluid changed. Three month wait, $750, plus parts, plus shop materials, plus disposal fee, plus tax
   I did the job myself, taking my good old time being very careful with brake fluid and being careful not to get air in the system. It took me less than an hour..
   while I was doing research online about maintenance since this was my very first BMW. I read everything. While doing research I found that it is not uncommon to have the final drive bearings fail.. I read the two guys that were entered in the iron butt , actually carried a spare final drive housing with them.. that‚Äôs how much they knew.
   aside from all the nice things I liked about the bike, I thought the windshield was unacceptably distorted for $22,000 motorcycle. The self alarming security system was a pain. It would reset even after a five minute gas stop. I had to dig in my pockets to pull out the key fob to push the button to unlock the security system to start the bike to continue on my trip every time I got gas..
  that BMW had a weird front end. You could not compress the suspension by pressing on it, by pumping the bars, you could not get that front end to go down, but, the front wheel would only come up when you hit irregularities in the road.The result of that system is, when you are in a parking lot doing tight turns at low speeds, And you tap the brakes at low speed, that kinetic energy of you moving normally would go into the front fork springs and be dissipated. But the front end on that machine does not compress from braking.. that energy has nowhere to go, and if you have the handlebars turned slightly, you better have strong legs and they better be long because you are going to be struggling to hold that machine up. I never dropped any of my three Yamaha ventures that I had close to 290 miles combined on, I never dropped my GL 1800 Goldwing, but I drop that BMW K 1200 LT two times in slow speed parking lot situation‚Äôs.
  I mentioned that to a group of 3K 1200 owners I bumped into at a motorcycle bike night. They all three started laughing and one of them walked me over to his bike. His mirrors were scarred, he said everybody drops them..look at both of my mirrors. he said the reason my mirror isn‚Äôt replaced is because they cost $490 each‚Ä¶The other 2 K1200 owners also agreed, they had dropped their machines also. That is one weird front end, and I now realize why no other manufacturer in the world has attempted to copy it‚Ä¶
   The rear brakes on my BMW made a horrible metal on metal grinding noise so loud, that people would turn to see what that noise was as I would be slowing down at stop signs and red lights. I mentioned this to my dealer. He said we can fix that. I say well what do you have to do. He said, and aftermarket rotor and pads. I asked how much is that. he said approximately $800, plus short material, plus disposal fee, plus tax
   I started to develop a different braking reflex.. it was not automatic, I had to think about it every time. And what I was doing differently was, I was not using the rear brake in slow speed areas, leaving my right hand free to finesse the throttle in conjunction with my left hand working the clutch at slow speeds. I had to start breaking with my right hand in these slow speeds, not touch the back brake, because of that embarrassing grinding noise‚Ä¶It was an awkward distraction because I would revert back to my normal braking habits, resulting in that screeching grinding noise.
 I had finally had enough. I thought they were the best machines , Because the most seasoned group of riders were the BMW riders,At least the ones that rode the air cooled twins were‚Ä¶
  I sold that machine, I had enough.. I was disappointed. I went out and bought a Moto Guzzi Norge, with heated grips, electric windshield, a pretty good seat, and ABS brakes that could be turned off at the push of a button, for those times when you get caught on a steep gravel covered road, or on wet grass on a slope, or get caught in the snow which I have had happened to me on several occasions. Luckily I was on machines that did not have ABS brakes so I made it home with brakes‚Ä¶ and Norge was my fourth guzzi.. I rode that machine for 14 years, no problem, 30 minute valve adjustment, I didn‚Äôt even have to remove the gas tank.. wonderful loping torquey motor‚Ä¶
  I thought I was buying the most wonderful most advanced machine capable of traveling for hundreds of thousands of miles when I bought that BMW. That was the most disappointing motorcycle of my life. I will never buy another BMW. ‚Ä¶You have to marry the dealer‚Ä¶
  before I get a lot of BMW owners pissed off at me. I sold my Norge a couple years ago and bought a Honda GL 1800 Goldwing. That was the first perfect motorcycle of my life. It was perfect. It did everything perfectly. it‚Äôs the smoothest thing in the universe, the ride will put you to sleep, it‚Äôs also perfectly boring. It had about as much personality as my toaster. So I sold it, and went back to a non-ABS motorcycle. A 2008 Yamaha venture. That is my touring machine at the moment.. it ain‚Äôt perfect, it is very comfortable and much roomier than the gold wing, I can get to the clutch, the slave cylinder, the water pump, the stator in minutes, they are not buried under plastic panels. They‚Äôre right there on the sides of the engine. I could practically service them with the tool kit if necessary. It does everything the Goldwing does except reverse..And, it gets 48 miles to the gallon so far. My Goldwing only got 33 miles to the gallon.. I had my first Yamaha venture for 16 years 138,000 trouble-free miles. I like  them.. that‚Äôs a great fairing. If it gets too hot to ride behind that fairing, I‚Äôll ride one of my other bikes that don‚Äôt have fairings..
One last note. Are used to be for BMW motorcycle dealers within 45 minutes of my home. Now there aren‚Äôt any. ..","I think your dealer pricing is highway robbery. My K1100 was costing less to run than equivalent Honda and Kawasaki, never found out about Yamaha, but probably the same. I have had the clutch replaced with original parts for approximately $2000 Australian dollars. A complete tear down of the K100 was $1700 to replace all gearbox seals and the input shaft, at about 200,000 Km. Anyone familiar with the K100 knows this is inevitable on K100 bikes. My K100&K1100 both made 300,000 Km before selling.

MsZL-__HHW0,"Now I know how to remove the dispenser drawer but I would like to know why the fabric softener section will not dispense the correct amount of softener and fills up with water that is still there when the cycle is over. Every time I do a wash even if I leave the softener out, there's always quite a lot of water left in the drawer which I have to siphon out. This machine is only 3 weeks old and has been like this from the very first wash.","@Save TheUmmah I had the Hotpoint engineer out to have a look at the machine and he did all the tests with his fancy gadget and said it was because the water pressure was too low and nothing was wrong with the machine. He swapped the infill hose from cold to hot and pointed out that it was filling properly now but we had to be aware that the hot fill hose may be little to harsh for delicates etc. We couldn't understand why the cold fill hose had always been alright with our previous washing machine and not with this new Hotpoint. To cut a long story short, we put the hose back onto the cold fill tap as it should have been all along albeit taking longer to fill, but discovered that that the softener dispenser still didn't empty properly. After trial and error we discovered that after the end of whatever cycle you choose and you check if the softener has gone, then its worked, but I have found a way to make this work. After the cycle has finished and the softener is still in the drawer, just turn your dial to spin and pump out. This only takes 10 minutes but at least you get the softener into your laundry. This shouldn't have happened right from the beginning but trying to get the engineer to understand that was a almost impossible. I was ready to get Hotpoint to collect the machine and I would go back to my beloved Boche make. I do hope this helps you to understand this problem with Hotpoint.",2020-06-08T10:02:49Z,2020-10-07T12:45:46Z,How to remove your washing machine dispenser drawer  | by Hotpoint,26,Hotpoint Customer Service UK,26,Howto & Style,trust,conflict,0,15,C_conflict,R_trust

having the same mechanical fuel pump as your splendid Frog eyes Sprite. I have your same problem: when the engine and the exhaust become hot, the fuel pump does not work and the car breaks down. I then intend to proceed with the installation of the electric pump you suggest. Before doing this  I would like to leave the original pump on trying to isolate as far as possible the pump from the heat, do you think it could be a viable solution? In any case, does the Huco electric pump you have installed have number 133010 and 12 volt?
Thank you for your kind reply and compliments for your Sprite!

A Roth IRA takes money that you already paid taxes on but all future distributions of the gains are tax-free in the US.

0wX6-lLidag,"So where do you get the Shellawax? Can you just pick it up at say, Woodcraft? Also, what pen kit did you use for that one?","Hello,
  I'll do my best to answer your questions. 

  The pen kit I was using was the Classic from Penn State: www.pennstateind.com. 

  I also purchased the Shella Wax from Pen State. I don't have a local Woodcraft so I'm not sure if they carry the Shella Wax brand but they do carry other shellac based pen finishes. 

  I made that video several years ago and quite a bit has changed in my refinishing method. 

  I use punches to remove the nib, transmission, and ferrel from the pen. For the classic, I would still have to tape the trim ring because it's glued on but most other pens can be completely disassembled.
 
  Once disassembled, you can use your normal pen mandrel and bushings to refinish the pen. 

  The original finish on that pen was Crystal Coat and Hut wax. If the pen had C/A on it, it would require sanding to remove that finish as opposed to just using the EEE Polish.
 
  I also no longer use Shella Wax for finishing pens. I love SW for items that are not handled often, like ornaments, because it looks terrific. Pens are handled daily and I found SW just didn't hold up. I now use C/A glue to finish all my wood and antler pens.
 
  I have several videos that explain the C/A technique I use if your interested. The brand of C/A I prefer is Insta-Bond and I get it from Packard Woodworks: www.packardwoodworks.com. 

  I sincerely hope this information helps.

0wX6-lLidag,Great video. This is a great idea! A lot cheaper than making a new pen.,"Thank you,
¬† This idea came out of necessity, some of the pens I made earlier in my turning days weren't holding their finish as well as I would have liked. I have even moved past Shella Wax and now use CA glue because once you get use to using it, It gives a great finish that is almost indestructible.

0WX6-qOYFvY,I think the X-Wing Starfighter is one of the best sets ever made by LEGO (cuz of its appearance in Star Wars in the Rebel Invasion on the Death Star) and it truly deserves a place in this top ten (instead of the Clone Turbo Tank which is in my opinion the worst of the 10 shown on your list).

B1 is also a vitamin that it's nearly impossible to overdose on so it's pretty safe. Take daily for at least a few months to help recover from past damage, if there is a lot of damage, years are recommended, it is possibly to slowly regain some of the lost brain function by doing this.

JgtJ-sFzWww,"Please stop praying to Mary, she has no power and neither does the rosary. Jesus Christ who is God himself has all the power. He died for your sins, he was buried and he rose again to save you. You have to believe this gospel to get saved and be saved permanently. Salvation is by Grace and The very definition of grace shows that salvation is free in and of itself. Grace translates to the Greek word CHARIS which means ""unmeritted favor."" This is why Paul says in ephesians ""for by grace you have been saved (past tense) through faith and NOT OF YOURSELVES, it is a gift of God. Not of works so that no one may boast."" This is also why in John's gospel (the one actually written to save the lost; see john 21:30-31) he gives the sole criteria to be saved which is to believe. This is also why Paul tells the church of Rome the difference between grace and works in Romans 11:7 ""For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.""And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."" Believe the gospel performed on your behalf (the death, burial and resurrection) and recieve eternal life today. Jesus died to pay the penalty for your sin which is death. If he already payed your debt then there is only one place to go.","@53n7w9¬† I said please because I have no other desire than to see you get saved, friend.

Matthew 6:7 KJV
[7] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

1. Repeating the same words over and over like a magic incantation does not guarantee that God will hear your prayer any better. It‚Äôs not wrong to come to God many times with the same requests‚ÄîJesus encourages persistent prayer (Luke 18:1-8). But he condemns the shallow repetition of words that are not offered with a sincere heart. We can never pray too much if our prayers are honest and sincere. When you pray, keep your heart and mind actively engaged. Make sure you mean what you say.

2. ‚ÄúTo repeat a form of prayer a very large number of times has always seemed to the ignorantly religious to be a praiseworthy thing; but assuredly it is not so. It is a mere exercise of memory, and of the organs of noise-making: and it is absurd to imagine that such a parrot‚Äù

‚Äúexercise can be pleasing to the living God. The Mahometans and Papists keep to this heathenish custom; but we must not imitate them.

God does not need us to pray for his information, for he ‚Äúknoweth what things ye have need of‚Äù; nor to repeat the prayer over and over for his persuasion, for as our Father he is willing to bless us. 
Therefore let us not be superstitious and dream that there is virtue in ‚Äúmuch speaking.‚Äù In the multitude of words, even in prayer, there wanteth not sin. Repetitions we may have, but not ‚Äúvain repetitions.‚Äù 
Counting beads, and reckoning the time occupied in devotion, are both idle things. Christians‚Äô prayers are measured by weight, and not by length. 
Many of the most prevailing prayers have been as short as they were strong.","We are sorry you have been led down the road of hating Christ's Church, but are sure it was not wittingly. May God bless you and your family in every way possible. I don't know what will happen at the Last Judgement but rest assured I am praying for you as much as for myself. We love you and respect you.

JgtJ-sFzWww,"I grew up praying the rosary and going on catholic retreats (Steubenville conferences). Around 18-19 I really started falling from the faith.

JgtJ-sFzWww,"Mathew 6:6-7
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking.","Matthew 6:7 And in praying do not heap up empty phrases (‚Äúvain repetitions‚Äù in KJV) as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.

Notice the context? Jesus said ‚Äúdo not heap up ‚Äòempty phrases‚Äô (Gr. ‚Äì battalagesete,  which means to stammer, babble, prate, or to repeat the same things over and over mindlessly) as the Gentiles do‚Ä¶‚Äù We have to remember that the main idea of prayer and sacrifice among the pagans was to appease the gods so that you could go on with your own life. You had to be careful to ‚Äútake care of‚Äù all of the gods by mentioning them, and saying all the right words, lest you bring a curse upon yourself.
And remember as well, the gods themselves were immoral at times! They were selfish, cruel, vengeful etc. The pagans would say their incantations, offer their sacrifice, but there was no real connection between the moral life and the prayer. Jesus is saying that this will not cut it in the New Covenant Kingdom of God! One must pray from a heart of repentance and submission to God‚Äôs will. But does Jesus mean to exclude the possibility of devotions like the Rosary or the Divine Mercy Chaplet which repeat prayers? No, he does not. This becomes evident when, in the very next verses of Matthew 6, Jesus says:

Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

Jesus gave us a prayer to recite! But notice the emphasis on living the words of the prayer! This is a prayer to be recited, but they are neither ‚Äúempty phrases‚Äù nor ‚Äúvain repetitions.‚Äù

Consider the prayers of the angels in Revelation 4:8:

And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù

These ‚Äúfour living creatures‚Äù refer back to four angels, or ‚ÄúSeraphim,‚Äù that Isaiah saw as revealed in Is. 6:1-3 about 800 years earlier, and guess what they were praying?

In the year that King Uzzi‚Äôah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.‚Äù

Someone needs to inform these angels about ‚Äúvain repetition!‚Äù According to many of our Protestant friends, especially Fundamentalists, they need to knock it off and pray something different! They‚Äôd been praying like that for ca. 800 years!",2022-05-15T23:10:15Z,2022-09-13T05:49:40Z,Pray with Us: The Holy Rosary,24,Ascension Presents,24,Entertainment,social_support,conflict,0,10,C_conflict,R_social_support

Ultimately I promised our Blessed Mother to recite it for 30 straight days. I have well exceeded thirty days and the transformation that has occurred in my heart and home is beyond my immediate understanding. My misdirected pain and anger have dissipated, I can breathe again. The memory of that last rosary was etched in heartbreak and resignation.

JgtJ-sFzWww,"I personally dont understand the Rosary. I find it very repetitive. I prefer to talk to God direct and just be real with him. God does not need us to use lofty language, restate the facts or use long winded prayers or mantras. If it helps you to focus your heart and mind on God and what he has done for you fair enough, but if you do it out of duty and it distracts from communicating with God. Just stop and pray direct to God. As his children we can come straight to him without barriers. We dont need to pray through Mary, Saints or Priests. When our Lord Jesus died the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom as a symbol from God that we can all approach him not just through Holy Jewish high priests. Jesus himself taught us that. ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."" All God's children regardless of age, wisdom, biblical knowledge etc.. can approach our heavenly Father in prayer direct.

üôèüèªThank you Lord Jesus for dying for my sins and breaking the barrier that seperated me from our Heavenly Father. No longer am I constrained but have been set free from the bondage of sin. Thank you God for ordinary men and women of faith past and present who have prepared the way that others might know and be in communion with you. Lord God I ask that you bring comfort and healing to the sick and needy today. Help support those who care and minister to them. I also lift up those who are dying. May they place their trust in you if they have not already done so and give them comfort and assurance that they will soon be in your heavenly arms in heaven where there will be no more sin, no more sickness and no more death. Comfort those who mourn and give them peace that their loved ones placed their trust in you! O holy Spirit be with us in all we say and do this day. Help us to be more Christ like in action and deed. Please give us opportunities to share the Gospel. We may not have the words but we ask that the Holy Spirit speaks though us to reach those lost and needing a Saviour this day. I ask all this in Jesus Holy name. Amenüôèüèª",Why are you typing a comment as a prayer here when you can pray directly to Jesus?

JgtJ-sFzWww,"I am a Protestant, raised Protestant. I have been interested and attracted to the rosary at different times in my life. Once I even re-wrote the rosary prayers, not to in any way disrespect the original words, but to make them more powerful for me. I found the rosary prayers online last night and went through them. I should get  a book and booklet in the mail from Amazon tomorrow on Christmas Eve. For whatever reasons, I feel a strong need to make the rosary a part of my spiritual walk (and work) right now. Although I feel a certain disdain for ritual or even just over-emphasizing the external aspects of our Bible stories (without deeply looking at the more internal ""symbolic"" ""allegorical"" or ""metaphysical"" aspects), I can't tell you enough how much I appreciated praying the rosary with you. For the first time in my life, during decade 3, I started to have a vision of the Virgin Mary and felt flooded with a sense of peace. I know that the purpose of prayer is not necessarily to seek certain ""feelings"" or ""sensations,"" as you said, Fr. Mark-Mary in a prior video, but to develop more of a ""relationship"" or a sense of deeper ""contemplation.""  I desire very much to go deeper now. As much as I have major issues with the Catholic Church in general and I could never ever in good conscience ever convert to Catholicism, I am grateful that the Catholic Church still exists and that these beautiful prayers, like the rosary, can be offered to the world. Thank you so much! I look forward to deepening my relationship with God, Mary, Christ, the archangels, angels and saints!

Remember, our omnipotent God already knows what you need and what you're feeling even befote you open your mouth. He knows whats inside our hearts, so there's really no use if we use the prayer in this video or the rosary. He knows whether youre lying or telling the truth.

Tell God what's really in your minds and in your hearts. Remember to also include your gratefuness and thanks for all the blessings you receive, like being able to wake up alive for another day, and also confess all of your sins (big or small).

YusvIv-6Q24,"So I spoke to the people who work in the arcade, and you won 7 Nintendo Switches so far. That's crazy!!!!!!! :D Nicely done!","That is nearly confirmed! It's actually 8. I just don't like bragging about how many that I won -- but it is 5 Animal Crossing Editions, 2 Splatoon 3 OLEDs and the most recent Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom edition.

Now before you ask this next question, do I still have them all? No, I sold 2 Animal Crossings, used 1 just for my own personal use, and still have 2 left untouched. Both my Splatoon 3 OLEDs are gone (by extremely high demand), but I can't wait to use my Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom edition sometime soon! It's just that I have invested so much of my free time invested into my Youtubing channel instead! I don't think I ever want to let go of the YouTube thing though -- I know it'll pay off for me in the very long run, and I'm happy things are really working out well on my end over here!

Sorry if I'm not selling anymore at the moment. I used to be heavy on the Squishmallows before they stopped shipping them in and I haven't seen anything new since February or March of this year! It's an amazing feeling to spend a few of these tickets to get all sorts of these high-end goodies! It's also really good promotion for the owners of this arcade that I collaborate with on their social media. People often ask me what prizes I can win at the arcade, and letting some people who swing by the arcade know what they have makes them come back for more.

YusvIv-6Q24,"I gotta ask man, but how much money did you spend on the arcade and how much did you make back? Not hating or nun, just curious is all.","Oh no, much obliged! I do this because a ton of people on YouTube who subscribed to my channel loves to see this sort of stuff!

Now earlier in 2021 (before I had a YouTube channel) I was making a bit of money off of my winnings. I normally spend $20 to $30 per session (which is basically a few hours down by the arcade each day sometimes) because the tickets come out of the machines the old school way. Waiting for a thousand tickets to come out normally takes 7-8 minutes each jackpot. Then you got the game techs to wait for if the tickets in the machine run out and then to shove all those winnings into the ticket eater sometimes take 90 min depending on how much I won.

It balances out and I lose money because I do play dance games and pinball games that don't give out tickets. At the end, it pretty much balances out. I tell everyone pretty much if you think you can make a living off of this it's better to just buy the PS5 or the Nintendo Switch etc. outright. I pretty much stretch my budget out and it normally equals the same, so if I spend $450 on a Switch for example, I stretch out about $400-500 in 4 weeks and then play those 4 weeks throughout. Gets good publicity (I realized), the owners of the arcade love it and so many people suggested I get a YouTube channel way too many times! I only got into it in 2023 since my hiatus began (too much work, trying to catch up in life. Etc.)

On a good day, I can win about 7000 tickets with $20. Hope that answers your question and thanks for dropping by!

Blade's hero journey is that he is not perfect and the only things that make sense are his family, who he must now turn against. The power he has is his only hope but when that is stripped away he must put aside his raging pain and is forced to place his trust and love in those who accept he is broken and see him as his new family.

K8yp-XogrrQ,I won't lie. Something about case 1 I always loved. I think it was a cool game and nicely made for the most part. Case 2 seemed good too but theres something about the first one I like. Like how u are surviving in one building for the whole game rather then the weird chapter system they have. The chapters are fine but its how some of them are more like dreams that are weird.

Zanzibaris wanted more relations with fellow Africans such Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, some sort of pan-African movement was afoot, but Arabs wanted more relations with socialist Egypt. Zanzibaris wanted to be seen as equals with the ruling Arab elite and rule along side with them but the Arabs were too arrogant for that. So the Arabs said they would hold elections and if they won they would rule along side them and the Zanzibaris agreed. Of course the elections were rigged in favour of the Arabs but the Zanzibaris saw through them and asked them how is it that towns with African majorities would vote for Arabs instead of them. Arabs replied it's because you're stupid. So then they began the massacre of the Arabs, when the Zanzibaris had defeated them and demoralised them from fighting any further they took up government.

J9AZ-eadA2I,Honestly I could see hk-47 working very well as a assistant for the mandalorian,"Spoilers for Kotor: He already did, for a different mandolorian.




If your repair skill is up to the task, you can dig into HK-47's memory to learn of previous masters. One of the earliest was a Mandolorian who claimed HK and ranked up by sending HK against his own superiors... until he tried this against Mandalor himself.



Alas, HK-47 couldn't defeat the leader of the Mandolorians and was reprogrammed to terminate his own master.

Honestly, his history of masters is like a parable about people using HK to kill without repercussions for a while, only for that same deadly tool to backfire on them.",2025-03-04T17:31:15Z,2025-03-09T06:59:13Z,The Mandalorian Gets An Assassin Droid ü§£,1,Zenger,1,Film & Animation,conflict,knowledge,3,13,C_knowledge,R_conflict

Of course, it's entirely possible that you simply may not have paid enough attention to Monika's character in order to realise this, but Monika isn't actually trying to protect her character file at all. She isn't trying to keep secrets from you. She sees you, the player, as essentially being her saviour - her knight in shining armour, come to give her a fresh new reason to carry on living in a world where nothing else really matters. She sees herself as being real, you see, and so with you, the player, also being real, Monika simply assumes that there's no way on Earth you'd actually go ahead and delete her character file, now that she's told you the truth - that she's basically a real human being, trapped in a game world.

She directs you towards her character file because she wants (and perhaps expects) you to protect it for her, which is what makes that hand-holding segment so clever. It's simultaneously giving you a blow-by-blow walk-through of what you need to do next, while at the same time revealing some of Monika's key personality flaws - that she is actually a hopeless romantic who is FAR too trusting for her own good, quite far from being the devious mastermind you may have taken her to be before that point. She's ultimately just a teenage girl who believes that she's finally found the one true love of her life, so to her, pointing you towards her only existing weak spot isn't dangerous - it's actually a show of love and trust. Like I said, she's a hopeless romantic.

So, yeah, you kinda dropped the ball on that one by missing the key message that segment was pointing out to you. Other than that, it was a decent enough review, I suppose. Could have done with a bit less of an attitude, though.

krq6-1ht_kk,"Okay, I was expecting him to rip it apart,  but he was actually pretty fair about it considering his experience with visual novel tropes as a whole. 

He is correct in saying that the game reaches its peak when the depression stuff happens,  but where I disagree is the rest.  Seeing as he was just looking at it as ""creepypasta horror game"",  plus his overall lack of interest in anime tropes in general,  he does understandably ignore a lot of the more subtle writing.  Like the fact that even before the fucked up shit starts to happen,  the issues and weird things were already in place,  it just got raised to eleven after the peak moment hit.  The music as well has a lot of interesting cues,  as well as the things in the files actually giving you more tidibits of lore about the game and its characters. 

Overall though,  his assessment as  a game reviewer with little experience in anime is pretty fair and even surprisingly not inflammatory.  The fact alone that he didn't dismiss the game as just another FNAF (at least once he played it)  is good enough to me.

krq6-1ht_kk,"Mmm. I would say this is a pretty fair review. If a bit too harsh. I say fair because I too pretty much saw most of it coming even having avoided as much spoiler as possible, not reading tags and so on. I just knew it was going to go real dark at some point. The game very blatantly shoves it in your face before it even starts. I understand maybe this was a requirement, this warning, but I would have been substantially more surprised as the game got darker if you didn't go 'WOAH IT'S GOING TO GET DARK'. 

Like I'd have been wondering exactly how far the dark would go. Would they just stop at mental illness for the girls and dig deep in that? Would terrible things start to happen? Could you prevent it? Instead I know it's going to go down the rabbit hole and then you get obvious game run amok vibes and it loses the mystique. To be fair I briefly wondered if the game would go down an entirely different branch of morbid, with how slow the build was, and have an apocalypse and you have to survive with the girls knowing what you know about each of them to your advantage to all live. But then it gets real blunt and there ya go.

It's not badly done in any particular way. But it's not as subtle or nuanced as it needed to be in my opinion to garner the attention it got. I expected more endings and file fiddling for fun in the post game at least. Like, to try a run with only Natsuki and Yuki and get an interesting experience. There's enough to fiddle with for some different experiences and if you're at least amused by it it's pretty fun. Free is probably the right price for it, yeah. Or maybe a few bucks tops. But it's a quality experience for that tier.

Honestly? I would have prefered a game that was just the actual premise. Write poems that affect what path your waifu dating takes. Maybe take out the jumping chibi blatant hints and then that could be pretty darn fun if you ran with it long enough and made it more complex.Then at the end maybe give the option to save all your poems as text files or something. Who knows, maybe they could've given you different poem formats to use for your own poems in the story?

Anyway, TLDR; Yahtzee is pretty right- he often is. But it's maybe a bit too harsh- which he can be now and then. Coulda done more with the game, but what's there is solid if you're into it. Free and reasonable quality.","SolarFlair Gonna stop you on the ""bit too harsh part"", this is Zero Punctuation.",2018-02-07T21:19:51Z,2018-02-07T21:31:03Z,Doki Doki Literature Club (Zero Punctuation),20,The Escapist,20,Gaming,conflict,knowledge,3,13,C_knowledge,R_conflict

Because, save for one route's climax, it IS a completely bogstandard dating sim. You meet the waifus, go down their branches and get your happy ending and your ""Happy Ending"". However if you go down one girl's branch, then decide that you'd rather not and go down another girl's path you find out some really interesting things: the girl is in love with the Player. Not the MC, the Player playing the game. She then brutally murders the girl you were with, and your character before crashing the game with no survivors. Starting it back up shows the game's glitched out. This game excels and takes things into account like coming back to the game years later. Latest I've seen is a contingency for some guy loading the game ten years later, in which the girl asks about how advanced computers have gotten. She also seems somewhat apologetic.
