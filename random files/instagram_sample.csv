feminism_in_print-2022017150176267008.info,"Did you know Brixton in London has a David Bowie mural? I have always love him: his influence on music, fashion, the LGBT community and overall coolness. At the same time, since his death I have learnt that he committed statutory rape, at least once (it's worth knowing the woman involved has defended his actions). So while we can celebrate Bowie's brilliance, we should also acknowledge the ways in which he and many other male celebrities abuse their power.  Therefore, in light of this knowledge, is it ok to have a public memorial that celebrate him? After all, when we treat public figures like gods, we enable the dangerous dynamic in which famous men prey on women and girls. As a society we need to be careful who we put on a pedestal. What do you think? -

freudandfashion-1723440181963291916.info,"How to set boundaries without disappointing others?? 🤔 That's a tough one, but if you're too worried about disappointing other people, then it's time to shift your mindset to prioritize your own needs, sanity, and wellbeing. This is especially hard if you're in school, training, starting a new job, tend to be the family member everyone relies on, etc. There's different ways one can learn to set boundaries and one technique I like to use is to weight the risk/benefit of taking a certain action.

Here's a work example: Patient arrives late for appt. If non-urgent, I can either A) Let them know they only have a few mins since they were late so I can stay on time with my schedule; or B) Say nothing about tardiness, spend the full appt time, thus making my other patients wait, thus causing me to leave the office late, thus making me irritable when I leave work, thus causing my patients to feel they can arrive late all the time without repercussion.

Here's a non-work example: Friend wants you to help them move, but you have NO time. Since your friendship is really important to you and you want to help out, the risk of helping the whole day = you fall behind on other prioritized tasks. Benefit of helping = you feel good about helping your friend and spare the guilt of not helping. Therefore, you can set a boundary by saying you'll help for a few hours, but have to leave at a SPECIFIC TIME -- that way you establish the time boundary and won't feel as guilty about leaving.

Well, those were just a few quick examples. I need to write a blogpost on this so I can elaborate further! If YOU have any tips or comments about setting boundaries, drop a comment below!! 👇 📷: @justinhphotos",1519670101,17849468623246557,"I’ve had clients who miss appointments/show up late and request that I call them the day before or day of to remind them of their appointment. At my office, we do not practice doing phone call reminders. However I always feel awkward or guilty telling the client that’s not something we normally practice. I do admit I have done it in the past, for one specific client, however as I gain more experience in the field I feel more confident telling me clients I’m sorry but that is not something we practice in our office, and I try to offer other suggestions as to how the client can make their appointment on time.",lori.cc,1519691629,17866744894221483,"@lori.cc thank u for your comment!

harmonyblazeblog-1825238690097495567.info,"F O O D 🥘 Food glorious food, isn't that how the song goes ・ For as long as I can remember I've had an unhealthy relationship with food; I've binged and comfort eaten when times are hard, I've starved and restricted myself beyond belief in search of that bikini body and I've even been a secret eater ・ I think my unhealthy relationship with food and body image issues go together hand-in-hand ... It's a vicious circle ・ I don't feel myself because I'm over eating, yet I comfort myself by eating even more ・ I feel that by acknowledging that I have a bad relationship with food is the first step on the road to improving it - I want to eat well, not eat lots and I want the food I eat to make me feel good inside ・ Now I'm not saying I'll never touch another takeaway or processed meal again in my life, but what I am saying is that I'll limit myself to just one takeaway a week (not several) and that I'll go back to treating my body with respect instead of abusing it ・ It won't happen overnight, it won't happen in the next week but hopefully slowly I'll start to have a better relationship with food again.

.

Apologies to Marisa and Chris that I am going to accompany a picture of their beautiful home with a caption about......potty training! We started our youngest on the potty just over a week ago armed with a value pack of paw patrol pants and the expectation that Chase and the gang would surely be getting regular golden showers for the foreseeable .

However the Miniest Malmo has taken us by surprise and taken to the potty like a pro with only one #PooinPawPatrolPants incident thus far. If anything his bowels have risen to the challenge too much as he is now waking himself (and us) up in the night to  go to the potty. Whilst i am obviously proud of his pooing prowess I am less eager to wake every night at 3am to cheer him on as he clears the decks! .

It feels like having all of mine out nappies is a bit of a milestone which makes me happy on the one hand as much less of my annual salary will be spent on Baby Wipes but sad because it is the end of the baby era for me. Is anyone else at a similar stage? Are you happy to leave the baby/toddler years behind? .

ijeomakola-2028429002145961634.info,"In my first two years of college, my grades in my science classes plummeted. The Bs I got my freshman year came as a shock to a formerly straight A student, but by sophomore year, those Bs turned into Cs.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
After barely passing Organic Chemistry, I knew that going to med school wasn’t in the cards for me. Not that I couldn’t do the work, but I didn’t like the material and couldn’t commit to caring enough to understand it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It’s not hard to remember that gut-wrenching feeling, the moment I realized the life I’d always envisioned - the one where I was a thriving pediatrician, making my parents proud after all the sacrifices they’d made to provide a better life and education for me than they could have ever imagined for themselves - wasn’t going to pan out that way I’d anticipated. I’m now very familiar with the anxiety and uncertainty of that feeling (it came back again during my PhD). But at the time, during my sophomore year of college, I was completely unsure of myself and my purpose for the very first time in my life, and I never thought that I would be able to fulfill my dream of going to graduate school.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’m sure you know by now that I ended up going to graduate school, and living a life that was completely unimaginable back when I was a sophomore! I’ll share soon what made me decide to take the @GREGeneralTest, but in the meantime, I’d love to check in with you - do you dream of going to grad school at some point, but feel like something about your background, your education, your abilities, is holding you back? #ad #GreatnessAwaits #GREtest",1556027601,17863949062375018,I feel i should but i have no desire to and in a way i feel like im disappointing my abilities..don't even know if that makes sense...meh,williamstanding,1556065891,18061606096059338,"@williamstanding doing it out of obligation is likely not the way to go.

simply_stacey_-1907617294022225881.info,"Somehow managed some productive moments whilst suffering a painful 2 day headache, another night of minimal sleep but this time as Josie was poorly through the night and then Rowan was in a tantrum mood today...topped by him wanting to potty train. In between emptying sick bowls and cleaning the floor, spraying dettol everywhere, cleaning up puddles of wee no where near the potty and building train tracks and Lego tunnels....I managed to edit a couple of videos ahead and set up my Pinterest schedule up to a week Friday 💪🏻 here is to tomorrow... should be easier as Josie is on the mend but has to stay off 48 hours. Oh and the puppy somehow got her mouth stuck in her collar?! You can see why this mug was needed. .

joyoushealth-1940372340980283274.info,"The sky and sunsets over Palm Beach are always so beautiful that the camera just can’t capture the full beauty of it.
.
It kinda makes me think about how Instagram doesn’t fully capture the true beauty, the ups and downs, of one’s life. .
Here you see the highlight reel — the yummy food (but only the really good shots) and the cute family photos — not the 10 before where someone was blinking, crying, laughing or simply not in the mood for a photo.
.
This year has had a lot of ups but of course there have been things that have bummed me out too, but...that’s real life for ya!
.
I am thankful for this community I have here because you guys have ALWAYS (with the exception of 0.0001%) been super kind, warm and appreciative of what I share with you. Your kindness pushes me to continue doing what I do — a kindness that can be tough to come by in the online world. I read ALL your comments and see you making my recipes with joyous delight!
.
I look forward to continuing to bring you more deliciousness and tidbits of living a healthy lifestyle in the most approachable way I can. Just remember though that Instagram is the highlight reel, even though everything I share is real life, it’s not my whole life. My food doesn’t always look Instagram worthy (and more often than not neither do I 😆😆).

aminaali_mua-1987289625999498793.info,"Hey guys so I’ve been taking these @beautyandthebear hair, skin and nail vitamins for the past few weeks. As a general multi-vitamin I think they are great as they taste so good so you want to keep eating them. This is one of the things I love about them most as I’m eager to eat them everyday and remember to eat them, whereas with a normal tablet multivitamin I always end up forgetting to take them or get heartburn! In terms of the stronger hair skin and nails I really can’t say as they do advise taking a 3 month course to see results. Do you take a multi vitamin? AD GIFTED

aliceellagram-1629724286237625950.info,"Where to start... last night I was invited to the London premier of the film @unrestfilm ... safe to say I cried my bladdy eyes out. Watching a story SO similar to mine on the big screen was heartbreaking yet empowering. Seeing people as unwell as I was (bed bound, wheelchair bound, unable to speak / eat / tolerate light or sound etc) has made me realise how far I have come in the 14 years since I got the dreaded #myalgicencephalomyelitis diagnosis... but it also broke my heart that so many (approx 17 million) people are suffering with this illness that most people haven't even heard of. It has more sufferers than some very well known and well funded conditions yet is still thought of as 'yuppie flu' or being in your head... which I can assure you it is naaaaat!!! @jen.brea stars in (and directs) the film portraying an honest documentary of her struggle with #mecfs - and after years of trying everything, she is still wheelchair bound. Is there any hope? - I was about to type 'no' 🙈but YES... YES THERE IS- please go and see this film- it is a beautifully told story of love, life and health and I genuinely think that everyone would benefit from not only learning about this illness but realising to appreciate what we do have. 💖 #unrest  #timeforunrest #filmpremier #unrestfilm #me #mecfs #mecfsawareness #mecfswarrior #cfs  #invisibleillness #invisibleillnessawareness #spoonie #spooniewarrior #spoonielife #me #myalgicencephalomyelitisawareness #millionsmissing",1508498296,17903177434018541,"Great review and glad you enjoyed it. I haven't watched the film, however I did watch Jennifer’s TED talk, and it highlighted how people with this hidden illness are treated by society, and the fact there is almost no funding for researching it, compared to other illnesses. Also that there is some hope with advancements in drugs for it.  From the trailer I have seen, she is lucky in that she has a partner to help her through it, as many people who have this type of illness don't have a partner or very close friends, and I think that can make a huge difference.  I have found that it is an illness that steals time, and can affect ones ability to have a relationship with someone special, partly due to how much energy is actually needed for a relationship. It also has the potential to steal future goals and ambitions in life. So even though I have a professional degree, I have never been able to work in my field of expertise, due to how much energy is needed for the work and the fatigue and brain fog I get. So I have had to sidestep to working part time for myself, and a lot of people with CFS seem to do this, and end up doing their own thing. It is an illness that seems to affect the most ambitious and skilled people.  I have had it for 20 years since a teenager, and a lot of that time I lived in denial by not telling people I had it, as I didn’t want sympathy,  nor people thinking I had this weird illness that they had never heard of, and I would have to explain it to them.  Luckily I have never been bad enough to need a wheelchair and can work part time to some degree, so many are in a far worse situation to me, so I am thankful for that. 
Awareness does seem to be growing over the last few years, and people like Alice is helping with that, so I thank you for that.  I would recommend that anyone who does have this illness, that they get friends and family to watch this so they can get a better understanding of it. There are still a massive amount of people out there, who either aren't aware of this illness at all, or don't believe it is real. My brother is one who needs to watch it.",designloungenz,1508588280,17904384865053533,"@aliceellagram Your singing is awesome, I am sure you will be successful one way or another. 😀 I guess with a lot of professions, the hard bit is having to put in a lot of effort initially to get your name out there, which isn’t easy when you only have a limited amount of energy to spend. That big break can come when you least expect it I have found.  I trained as an Architect myself for 5 years at uni, which is a really demanding job to work in, and they expect people to work long hours. However I have still managed to design houses for family which they do live in, so have still managed a bit of success along the way, even though I have had to pace myself with my energy levels. It is a balancing act.

sarahfit-1837437223680939917.info,"Nursing Tommy those first 6 weeks was harder than pregnancy and labor combined. With Connor, it’s been an entirely different experience and began with ease likely because of my struggles and prolonged success with Tommy. Apparently it’s #nationalbreastfeedingweek so I just wanted to say that #fedisbest - I somehow fought through the pain and it did get better but I don’t look down on anyone who chooses that breastfeeding isn’t for them. It felt like shards of glass were stabbing me through the nipple every time he latched. And then when he would spit up more than a mouthful, I knew I’d have to do it again momentarily. I was determined, never gave up, got a healthy/happy buddy and it saved me a lot of money on formula. I was so nervous before Connor arrived that I would have to endure similar pain but I did not. There is hope if you did not have success with one child. But know that there is no shame in not being able to do it. It’s not for the faint of heart. I also have no shame nursing in public and you shouldn’t either but i do prefer to cover up because I’m still the girl who has issues changing in the locker room. 🤷🏼‍♀️ #nationalbreastfeedingmonth #normalizebreastfeeding #fedisbestwhetherbottleorbreast #newbornboy #newbornbaby #mewbornlove #breastfeedingmama #breastfeedingmom",1533259607,17967555691063352,"@sarahfit almost exactly my two pregnancies!!

Guilt. Guilt. And more guilt. That I put on myself. Motherhood, you strive to give your child what you think is best. Took me weeks to come to terms with pumping and eventually supplementing to fill on formula. End story, I still have a very healthy 5 year old little lady. The struggle was real.

It’s not your usual success defined by numbers and things but I’m here growing, changing, moving in ways that is different not better by all means just different. •

brokemillennialblog-1876913923287730716.info,"This is probably one of the biggest (financial) ways Peach and I are different and that's okay. Our overall financial goals align, but he feels less stressed about the existence of his student loan debt than I do. Probably because he's been dealing with it for years. He (and now we) does pay more than 2x the minimum due, so the loans are not on the slow burn repayment schedule. He also shaved off thousands of dollars ahead of schedule by himself on a teacher's salary in NYC. I would just rather raid more of our savings to get rid of it today, which is more of an emotional move than a rational one.

What would you do? Pay it off aggressively by raiding savings/investments or focus on other money goals? ▫️

thebutterhalf_-2005208438461164801.info,"“Be strong and let your heart take courage.” This is a picture of me from 2015. At the time I was elbow deep in gouache and paint. 🎨 And I remember thinking, “Wow, my paintings are laaaammee.” But looking back on photos of my creations with a new set of eyes in 2019, I feel proud. There was even a moment of, “Who me?! I made THAT?” 👏

And it’s special to me that I chose that quote. Because one of my dearest friends @rachel_rebuilt told me a few weeks ago to STAND IN MY STRENGTH. And I’ve been clinging to that motto. Because I’m human and I have moments of doubt and despair, especially when I am in the thick of pushing myself to break through old belief systems. It’s messy and hard, and easy to fall victim to our own shortcomings and lies we tell ourselves.

Listen, life gets confusing, lonely, and frustrating at times. Even when on paper (or social media) you have it all, in the proverbial sense. Or if you don’t! Being human is hard. But being human is transcendent.

I am paying it forward to you with that motto. STAND IN YOUR STRENGTH. Choose faith over fear. Be strong, and let your heart take courage. ✨",1553259495,18030704440100888,"Why are we so hard on ourselves? That painting is A-FREAKING-mazing!

theflyingfitfoodie-1779973882770848478.info,"❓One of my most frequently asked questions is about how I meal prep when it comes to my trips. If you’re trying to watch what you eat or save money there are a couple of tricks I’ve learnt to make both of these a little easier when travelling. ✈️➡️
-
❌Firstly check if your destination allows you to bring in fresh food, otherwise you will be wasting your time and could potentially face hefty fines if you don’t declare it (USA, Australia,South Africa are no-gos for fresh items)
-
✅Pick foods that travel well - fruit in its skin like bananas and oranges are perfect just make sure they are protected from being squashed!
-
🍫Snacking bars - I never go away without a one! Protein bars are great  on the go snacks but pick wisely - most “healthy” breakfast and protein bars have stacks of hidden sugar.
-
🥗Prepping - it’s easy to pre make a salad but leave the dressing out until you’re ready to eat it to stop it from going soggy.
-
🥑I often take a small hass avocado with me on my flights to add to my salad if I don’t have a dressing (or if it leaked inside my bag, which often happens!)🙈
-
❓Do you have any neat little tips and tricks for healthy eating when you’re on the road or flying? I’d love to hear them!😊

laurenbrant-1971699148337360157.info,"Minimalism. Why me? Why now? Like half the population, I recently ‘Kondoed’ my life (the Marie Kondo Method) ✌🏼Basically this method concentrates on a positive and feel good future, within your own home. So you say thank you and farewell to any items which don’t bring you joy of some kind & only keep those which you envision in your ideal future. You love & respect your home and what you choose to have it in! .
.
.
During my process - I got rid of SO much stuff. Like I’m talking thousands and thousands of dollars. Some I donated and some I gave to friends and family. Expensive furniture, watches, dresses, unopened make-up, jewellery... etc! But a lot of these things have been with me for 10 years +, I’ve moved 7 times with it all.... and have never even thought of splitting ways with it. .
.
.
Well what this process made me realise is that I used to value the material things I had. If I could have cupboards and shelves full of things and endless options, I would feel fulfilled and a certain substance to my life. These things made me, me! In the past 5 years, I have grown so much through many life experiences and realised that things, don’t make YOU. You make you. Having a deep connection and understanding of yourself and awareness and focusing on pretty much everything un-materialistic, is what makes you YOU! .
.
.
As far as that fulfilment I was always seeking, well since meeting Barry and having Miller... my heart is so full and my life feels fulfilled with these things that money can’t buy. My bags have been pushed to the back of the cupboard, my make-up goes on once a week if that and I see so much beauty in moments, emotions and experiences. .
.
.
So I find myself now on a journey of minimalism. Only inviting things in that are truly going to add to our lives and raising our children to invest in themselves and people they love and who love them back, not things x",1549264876,18004257415141853,"Love this babe, I am doing the same... huge clean out/ de clutter/ down sizing...

heykayelle-2003884454444844820.info,"Since I get up at 5 a.m, my “crash” happens at around 11 a.m and it’s perfect timing because that’s when Grootie goes down for a nap! #ad This is when mommy gets some quiet time to indulge in another cup of coffee and dare we say it, chocolate! Nothing is more indulging than a “Lindor Melt Moment,” you know that smooth feeling that makes you feel like life is okay again? You NEED these moments. Sometimes, these moments comes in a little ball wrapped in an iconic @lindt @lindt_chocolate red cellophane.  One tip I can give you busy moms, is to STOP chugging your coffee. Truly make time for it. I know, it can be hard, but if you can sit down for 5-10 minutes. Smell it, grasp it with both hands and breath in the smoothness from your coffee like the Blonde Sunrise Blend From @starbucks….and then, take your first sip. It truly makes all the difference in how you feel about that moment.  I know we hustle and bustle all day long, but you gotta take a minute to enjoy the big and small. Take a moment to enjoy these little indulgences, and allow them to take you away for 5 minutes before your children calls out to you.  Trust me, these little things, it makes your day to day, feel well, less day to day. #LindtStarbucksKroger #mommyhood #houstonblogger #1yearold @krogerco Side Note: The Blue Berries & Cream White Truffles tastes like heaven!!!

I’m going to bandy them round a bit more here when I say that layering and texture are the key elements to creating a wow factor festive table setting. I’ve layered a simple white Snowflake dinner plate with a bold geometric side plate, added a pattern clashing napkin, gold cutlery tied with brown string (it’s all about the high low) and a pretty sprig of mimosa to top it all off.

xtinasullivan-1932113980757101775.info,"It’s the first morning of my honeymoon and I am miserable.
.
Brian and I sit down for breakfast, without hesitation he orders what he wants to eat; Stuffed French Toast. It’s my turn to order as i look at all the delicious things i can enjoy and I say in a snotty tone “egg white veggie omelet, no toast, no potatoes”.
.
Our food comes to the table and I’m immediately annoyed at my new husband. This photo is the actual photo of this moment. This was not staged, this was my face when the food came to the table. I have to sit here and eat this flavorless egg white omelet when all i wanted was to enjoy myself. But i can’t enjoy myself because I’m not “allowed”. I’ll gain weight immediately if i order the chocolate chip pancakes i really want.
.
The next morning i decided to would allow myself some pancakes...but it sent me down a path of overeating the rest of the trip. As soon as those pancakes hit my lips, i lost all control.
.
The All Or Nothing mentality over food had to stop. Letting a simple meal dictate my mood was incredibly depressing. Why cant I just be normal?!
.
I had enough, it was time to change my eating habits. My biggest tip when going out to eat is to NOT restrict yourself, but eat what you want in moderation. The way i learned to do this was to start SHARING. I started to order what i wanted along with something healthy, and share the food with my husband. This was just the beginning of my journey to Mindful Eating
.
Do you have an All or Nothing mentality with food? Will you try this simple tip to shift your eating habits from eating everything on the plate to enjoying a few bites? Give me a 🙋🏽‍♀️ in the comments if you’re down for this!

ohlovelyday-2015653942562117041.info,"Some of you might remember a scary incident we had with Calvin less than a year ago — Memorial Day to be exact. Calvin woke up not feeling well, made his way to the couch, and fell asleep. He seemed off, beyond just not feeling well. He had been swimming the day before so my red flag instantly went up and I thought “dry drowning.” So we tried to wake him up to check on him and he wasn’t responsive. Long story short we ended up at Children’s ER, then admitted to the ICU, and remained there for two days. After a lot of tests and months of sugar checks and a hospital re-admission to monitor a 24 hr fast he was diagnosed with ketotic hypoglycemia. Which basically means he can’t handle his blood sugar going too low and after a fast (like sleeping at night) it could get lower than it should. But all we need to do is prevent long fasts, which basically means he has a bedtime snack and eats soon as he wakes up. Almost a year later and we haven’t had any other incidents. But this morning he woke up not feeling well and then started vomiting. What would just be a stomach virus can also be a catalyst to a low blood sugar incident for Cal because he couldn’t keep anything down. Gatorade wasn’t working and I watched his sugar go to 87 and then to 74. Then he started getting really lethargic and somewhat unconscious (like sleeping but barely rousable). I managed to squeeze a straw into his mouth and woke him enough to suck down some Sprite. It was cold and he didn’t like it but it woke him up enough to drink some apple juice instead. Within minutes he was alert and seemed much better. While 50 is the level where we are supposed to become really concerned, today at 70 he scared us and acted a bit like he did last year, when he could have died. Just sharing as a reminder to always listen to that little voice or that red flag or that neck prick or whatever you feel when your gut is trying to get your attention. Calvin hasn’t thrown up anymore and I’m thinking the whole thing was sugar related but he’s eaten and is now playing and loving on everyone like usual.

I swear I get THE WORST jet lag. Even just one hour difference will completely throw me off. I love visiting the east coast, but y’all can’t have that EST mess😣. Anyway...I had a wonderful time in Indy, and no sooner than I got home Friday night it was back to the grind which included day of local shopping Saturday morning. On the agenda was making it to the grand opening celebration of the new Sacramento @kirklands store! I had never been in a Kirkland’s before so I was excited to check it out. The store was really pretty and there were lots of people scooping up great seasonal decor pieces. I immediately found this awesome shag rug and furry pillow for Bry’s room! We’ve been looking for both for her for months so it was exciting to finally find ones she liked. They even sparked a fun repurpose of this textile she’s had. I’m loving this little bit of boho she let me creep into her room🙌🏿. There were a few other things I spotted at Kirkland’s I can’t wait to go back for. Hope everyone is off to a fantastic day! .

s_marga-1687148595341393459.info,"How do I pay for my travels pt. 463774! For a lot of people this might be obvious, for some this is still a mistery and I still get asked about this a lot. The biggest spending during travels is mainly accommodation. I barter hotel stays in return for photography. So I stay for free and produce pictures for social media. This helps me to invest that money in doing some special and unique activities in every place I visit. 
So here are some tips... You dont have to have 100K insta followers to do the same. My friend started getting free hotel stays just with 5K. You have to know how to present yourself, how to market your skills, what to offer and how to explain that you are exactly what they need (comes with practice). Also dont start with 5 star hotels, I started with hostels and saving 15 bucks a night and getting private room was still worth it. You dont even need to be a photographer (I am not)! There was time before insta (is it possible?!) when I exchanged free dinner for correcting mistakes in restaurant's russian menu. A time when I traded some basic Instagram tips for a zip line ride 🤣 When I was recorded for a safety video in exchange for a free bike. I personally know a couple who travel the world and trade their singing skills for staying and working in hotels. They get all the tips, place to stay and food, hotel gets free amazing singers! 
Any skills can be usefull! Can you dance, sign, know photoshop, Instagram, marketing or just got a cool idea that can help a business? The only thing you have to do now is not to be afraid to use those skills, speak up, email people and present yourself to them. It is not easy, it even sounds not easy...but this is what I do and it was always worth for me. 😊 Helpful? Got questions? I m waiting for your comments ♥️

I was nominated for my voice-over work in 'Suspense"" and since spending the last 3 years in college and not auditioning, the 'Suspense' family has been the best blessing, as my creative family. I am most grateful to focus the entire experience as an artist as a positive one! I loved the opportunity to spend time with my young peers throughout the show. It was a non-win for me, and other artists alike. I want to say that honestly, this isn't about winning but enjoying a wonderful journey. From the casting to rehearsals and finally working on projects! We should simply appreciate this adventure, as many of our parents love us no matter what, and give so much for us to HAVE #FUN in this business. The Class of 2018 at YAA was able to look back at 39 years of this award show, which included artists like the wonderfully awesome @leonardodicaprio who was once a non-winner. He IS still working! And might I add working hard, growing and accepting the challenges of this industry. So, to the youngest artists who had sad little faces, you were deserving of a nomination and we all celebrated YOU! I also, have to admit, I adore the youngest artists, their natural sweetness and getting to know them and their families. There were many faces I want to hire for my future films!!!

Even though, logically, I know that comparison is the thief of joy, I do it anyway, especially since the DIY Project Panel. I was surrounded by so many talented and successful people that I found myself trying to think of ways to be more like them, namely monetizing my blog so I can help support my family. But I have to remind myself (many times a day) that it is not quite my time yet. I have young babies and I’m still so new to a blog. My goals will come in time, and I just have to be me to accomplish those goals. I don’t need to be someone else. I have a unique perspective to offer, even if I don’t quite know what that should be yet. Just be you and it’ll all work out just the way it’s supposed to. .

sewinglikemad-1892150217940625474.info,"Today I'm going to talk about an alternative to the burrito method. I know it's everyone's favorite but the more we know, the better we can chose what's right for each of us. Personally I've never used the burrito method. The idea of crumple up your whole beautifully pressed garment inside a tiny space makes me shiver (oh the drama 😂). So what do I do instead? I chose a simple example of a double shoulder/back yoke in a shirt to show you. You want all the seams hidden inside. This is a kids size, so my method works on small things too. First photo: the first seam is easy. Inner and outer yoke is placed on each side of the back bodice layer. Swipe➡️Outer yoke has been sewn to front bodice pieces. Swipe➡️ Now we need inner yoke to be sewn to that seam too. Swipe➡️ I have two openings here to do it from. Neckline (shown by my fingers) or part of armscye (shown my scissor). Neckline is biggest so that's what I choose. Swipe➡️ Now I grab in through the hole in the neckline. Get a firm hold of the front bodice/outer yoke seam plus the layer of the outer yoke, just the way I want them to end up when sewn. Pull the three layers out and do NOT let go... Swipe➡️ ....before you have secured it with a few pins. That way you know nothing is twisted. This is the most simple type of the bag-sewing-technique but in other cases, twisting can be a bigger issue than here. Now sew on top of the stitch already there. But this time the outer yoke layer will also be included. Swipe➡️ This photo is showing you how much of the shirt is NOT crumpled up inside the yoke, when using this method. Swipe➡️ And here is the result. Not pressed yet so you can see the seam better. Swipe➡️ And a look inside the yoke, where all the seams are hidden inside. I do understand why the burrito method is popular. This action can be hard to wrap your head around and the photos of the burrito method are usually much clearer than this way. So I get it. But now you know another way and maybe you are curious to try that one out too. So far I haven't met a pattern where I couldn't use this way. From yokes in double layers to anything with a lining. #miessewingtips",1539781904,17990618749031769,"This is how I do it too... much fewer crumples than with the burrito method!

sarahparkerpics-1987994588393343554.info,"My little Book Worm
📖
Not only is my crazy little man now starting to look more like me, but he’s most definitely inherited my love of books. I can’t say I read as much as I used to pre babies, but I do snuggle in and read with Louis every night. If children’s fiction counts, I can say I’ve read the majority of Roald Dahl over the past 6 months, and it’s been wonderful re meeting those story characters with Louis.
•Inspired by our trip to Story School last week @chessingtonworldofadventures I’ve posted a new blog about our day and some tips we picked up from professional storyteller Kevin Graal. Would love it if you had a read! (Link in bio).
•
Have you started reading some of your favourite childhood stories with your kids? I used to love the Allan Ahlberg stories...Remember Funny Bones, The Jolly Postman and Mrs Wobble The Waitress. I’m keen to get some more classics on the boy’s bookshelf. Any other great book ideas?

given_today-1826350555544759395.info,"This seems like a lifetime ago! Zola wiggled nonstop in my belly. 
When we got Zola’s diagnosis, I was devastated. It’s an easy word to encompass an arrange of emotions. As I sat and uncovered the different emotions I felt, there were some that didn’t surprise me like fear and sadness, but the  one that did was grief. • •

I felt an overwhelming sense of grief and I couldn’t understand why. The best thing a friend of mine told me, as I explained all these emotions washing over me, was “it’s okay to grieve the baby you thought you had and the path you thought you were headed down.” • •

I realized I was grieving the pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum experience I had planned on having, I was grieving the baby I thought I’d have, the plans we were making for the new chapter in our lives, Grey’s experience during this transitional period from one to two kids, and so much more. • •

Hearing that it was okay to grieve, was exactly the “permission” I needed to do just that. So if you’re going through a CHD journey, traumatic experience, a challenging time, or other unexpected change of plans, here is your “permission” to grieve. Take time to feel those feelings of loss and disappointment, it’s okay to feel that way.

I come to the mountains to show myself that I am more able than I give myself credit for. So I challenged myself and climbed 2 miles up Elk Mountain to eat lunch at 2500 ft above ground. On the way down we hiked off trail and rock climbed down. For those not ready for that steep of a climb, they have easy-difficult mountain trails and even handicap accesible ones! You can see prairie dogs and drive up Mount Scott if you're not able to hike which is perfect. Best part is, this park is completely free! What is one way you challenge your disabilities?

A few of you know the struggles I’m going through right now and left me the sweetest messages the dearest text and the most touching DMs.  My time with you on IG looking at your beautiful photos of your homes and family, reading your comments, and feeling your love and goodness  truly brings me happiness. •
 Sometimes I question myself, wondering if I’m nice enough, smart enough (spelling errors🙄) or creative enough to be on IG. •
But there should be no room in my head for that.  I learned a few weeks ago at an organizing conference that we need to practice self love.  if we don’t love who we are, how can we love other for who they are? Be so kind to yourself today. Acknowledge your hurt feelings your painful trials, your failed attempts at a four layered cake and then move on to the things that you are nailing, like being kind, getting the dishes done, heck waking up was a big one for me today 😂😂. We do so much good for others don’t forget to do good for yourself what ever that may be. •

ayeina_official-1983507715541765614.info,"We go to the parks and the parks are empty. We call the neighbourhood kids and all the kids her age & beyond are in school...So sometimes maintaining a social life as a homeschooler can be a challenge if you don't have other homeschoolers around. Unless you enroll kids in after-scool activities (often starting after 4yrs). Kids from the neighbourhood used to come to our place, but lately - with their extended school timings - they're too tired to play before maghrib.
.
.
So @everydayibaadah workbooks have been my lifeline! 💜 Alhamdulillah they helped my 3 year old jump slightly ahead of kids her age in terms of phonics, letter recognition & writing.The ""first 100 sight words"" book will iA help her read independently now so my reading job is minimised🤭
.
.
For the 10 month old, I've set up all her fav things from around the house in a drawer. Prepping for some #Ramadan sanity too!

If you don't want kids to be on screens, you need backups because having kids around 24/7 can be exhausting. So each time you break in two, remember this hadith...
.
.
""A (poor) woman entered upon Aisha with her 2 daughters, and she gave her 3 dates. (The woman) gave each of her daughters a date, then she split the last 1 between them. She (Aisha) said: 'Then the Prophet ﷺ came and I told him about that. He said:' Why are you surprised? She will enter Paradise because of that."" [Ibn Majah 3668]
.
.
When I break my time in 2 and sacrifice my dreams, it reminds me of this hadith.

When I share my bed space with one arm stuck beneath one child and other wrapped around the 2nd, it reminds me of this hadith.

When I break my back as I bend backwards, it reminds me of this hadith.

When I share my body by hosting one inside my belly and nursing the other, it reminds me of this hadith.

When I break my sleep in 2 over and over as I console one child and feed another to slumber, it reminds me of this hadith. .
.
And this hadith acts like a balm on the days when I question myself whether it's all worth it? And I sit there imagining about jannah that I sometimes fail to see beneath my feet.

jacobmanningyoga-1812490612168831203.info,"Today was a super emotional day. I felt many waves of feelings that moved me closer to my friends and to my spirit.  I have never delt with my feelings and emotions in a healthy way my entire life. I’m learning how to sit with my feelings and not react on them, not seek validation, not distracting myself from my feelings and not use people to make me feel better about myself. We all have our own journey in life and deal with our emotional and mental sates differently. As I’ve made choices that cause me pain, guilt, sadness and hurt  based on selfishness and self seeking motives I’ve had an opportunity to grow and take a look at my part. Growing in a way that changes me from the inside and allows me to not judge others in their own journey with their own life, having their own experience.

luamarchi-1996367283672446213.info,"If you are after the perfect destination for your next adventure you should definitely consider about planning a weekend getaway to Noosa to the upcoming May. I thought it would be nice to share useful pieces of advice regardless to the distance you are running;
1- Fuel up on good quality of food. Proper Nutrition is primordial for making it through.
2- Invite a friend to run with you. It makes easier when you have a buddy to push you to keep moving forward.
3- Hydrate it can get really humid at the Sunshine Coast where is summer the entire year ☀️
4- Pick your running distance (5K, 10K, 21K, 31.6K, 42K) and train for it. You've got 10 weeks for proper training. The key is preparing your body for the distance.
5- Running performance is more mental than physical. Your mind will define how far your body can go.
6- Make sure you schedule a day in Noosa (@visitnoosa) to relax and recover by the beach. You need adequate time for muscle repair and to restock energy stores. A dip into the ocean may help to replenish your magnesium  stores 😏😊 Check it out the @runawaynoosa Facebook page for top tips from the Olympian Craig Mottram (elite_wellbeing) .

Confession time!
I absolutely HATE being in photos! If I am, y’all are lucky! However, I try not to show my face at all in the photos. The reason is because I can’t stand to look at myself. I have TERRIBLE skin complexion. Plus, I have the biggest double chin you’d probably ever see from someone my size and weight. It makes me look like I’m 300+ pounds (I’m not skinny, but I’m also not that fat either). Not kidding! I see people way bigger than I am that don’t have a double chin nearly as large as mine. It’s so not fair! 😭 With all that being said, maybe I’ll show my face in a post again someday. Who knows! 🤷🏼‍♀️

Happy #ShelfieSunday! This is actually an older picture. It is an outtake of the photo shoot I did when I shot my profile pic.

Extra Info:
✨Outfit is from Kohl’s (my favorite clothing store).
✨Rose is from Hobby Lobby (my favorite prop item store).
✨For all my fellow piano peeps, the keyboard shown in this pic is the Yamaha Portable Grand DGX-640. My dad got me it for my 18th b-day. Before it, I had to play on my mom’s 20+ yr old Yamaha keyboard. 😆
✨TOG pillow behind me was designed by @eviebookish.

With my assigned two colors that were not my style I was truly pushed to a new creative limit. Thank god for being able to use white, black and metallics. The walls, furniture, hanging pieces, accent decor, table runner and the floor were all painted using Wagner Spray Guns.

terryderon-2019894632862743021.info,"Women often ask me questions about cheating and most seem to be under the impression that there’s only one thing that leads to it. And that usually isn’t the case. Most dudes don’t go into relationships or fall in love with plans to cheat. Most men judge the dating phase with a woman and assume that those will be the conditions for the relationship. But the thing is people rarely get in arguments or have to address serious issues in the dating phase and the newness of the situation puts a positive cloud over everything. But that disappears over time. And that’s where how he interacts with her, how they resolve issues, the sex or romance levels, and her overall behavior become more of an important factor. And that’s where a lot of women fall off. So that’s why I spend so much time breaking down how men feel about things so that women can learn to identify some of these mistakes that push men away and make them want to cheat or leave a relationship.

I wholeheartedly relate to the never ending lists, picking up the same toys every day, scrubbing pen from the new table (please tell me this happens to you too 🙈🤯🤣😭) but something I look forward to every day is our family meal time because I’m forced to slow down and go at their pace.
.
Every evening out entire family (all five of us) sit down together at the table and enjoy a meal, screen free and present.
It doesn’t look perfect. There is often food on the floor and the kids are almost always negotiating over who gets to sit next to Leo 🙈🤣, we have a toddler who doesn’t yet have the cognitive capacity to sit still at a table, we have a tired preppy 😴 and we have a baby who is learning how to eat. I feel you when you say it’s chaos🤪. But we lead by example because we know it’s worth it for meal time success, for our relationship with food and for our family. We know it’s important that our kids see us eat, even if they choose not to.

My closet used to have about 8 pairs of blue jeans, lots of “one hit wonders” that only went with one other thing, two cardigans--one black and one grey, and lots of dressy and business casual pieces that were pretty impractical for my incredibly casual job.

My intentions are pure and my intention is to help you heal. Science reveals to us that we are not victims of unchangeable genes. It is a fact that we have more control over the health of our mind, body, and soul than we have been taught to believe. I want to empower you with new understanding. The human body is miraculous and I want to show you that there is an extraordinary healer within all of us.
.
This post, in particular, is dedicated to healing your skin. This is my MOST REQUESTED POST! Too many times, clients have sat in my makeup chair in tears. I’ve had celebrities break down about how they’ve tried every product and still their skin issues makes them feel insecure. I’ve had brides upset that they’ve struggled with their skin most of their lives and are fearful that they won’t have glowing skin for their wedding day. I’ve had social influencers in my chair crying to me that every beauty company sends them a massive amount of popular and expensive products and they still don’t feel comfortable without photoshopping or layering on filters in their photos to hide their skin issues.
.
I want to help you. You are capable of healing. It doesn’t matter if you have 1 million followers or none. This post is for everyone. You are worthy. You are beautiful.

Click the 👉🏼Link In Bio to read about my personal skin struggles through out the years along with why I don’t believe essential oils should ever be put on your face and why I believe you should throw out your rose water spray immediately! Don’t fall into the traps of good marketing, trends, and be quick to purchase all the products that your favorite influencer is being paid to endorse! You will save yourself money and save your skin frustration! 🙊

James was THE worst sleeper the entire first year of his life, and didn’t sleep consistently through the night until he was 14+ months old. Even then, he was an early riser for a long time. We tried EVERYTHING, and I do mean everything, including trying to hire a sleep consultant. We were doing everything “right”, but our child still did not sleep! It was a rude awakening after Elodie, who started sleeping through the night on her own at just 11 weeks old. And now, my awful sleeper takes 2-3 hour naps almost every day and sleeps 12-13 hours a night every night. It goes to show that everything in parenthood really is a phase — the good and the bad.

Hey what's up!  I'm Rick LaFaver.  LaFaver, (etymology Le Fabre) roughly translates to ""the artisan"" which is ironic since no one in my family has been any sort of artisan, (until I got here). I am WoodWorkLIFE.  The idea behind WoodWorkLIFE was to talk about woodworking and life, but it became...whatever it is.

I am a part-time woodworker/content creator from St. Louis (from the LOU and I'm proud) and I have a day job as a data analyst.  The first video I ever made is the first video for my YouTube channel from October 2016 making my wife a 5th anniversary present. 
I have always been a hobbyist, and have worked in several Carpentery and home remodeling jobs, but I got into furniture and cabinetry, working at a company building enclosures for SUPER high end speakers. 
That's a little about me, happy to answer any other questions you might have.  Keep your tools sharp and your mind sharper! (I made that saying up too, as far as I know)

I'm Emily and my goal is to help you create a beautiful, organized home. I wholeheartedly believe that DIY projects don’t have to be huge – even the small stuff counts! This community is a place where we inspire each other to try new projects, share our wins and fails, trade organizing tips, get paint in our hair, and talk all things home. 🏡

I'm wife to David, mom to 15-month-old Chloe, and dog mom to Freya.💕
-
🎲We love board games in this house! Our collection has grown to more than 100 games that are haphazardly stacked in a closet upstairs. That’s a definite future organizing project!
-
😴Sleeping is one of my super powers. I can basically sleep through anything. Today our daycare teacher said Chloe is the only baby who will sleep straight through nap time until they wake her up. Like mother, like daughter!
-
After our house and my parents’ farm, the @iowastatefair is my next favorite place on the planet. Now if only they’d bring back the fried butter!
-
Growing up, there were 3 of us girls for 2 Bedrooms so we would rotate who shared a room and who got their own. I was constantly wanting to switch rooms because that meant I could spend a whole weekend cleaning and organizing and rearranging everything. -
I’m a reluctant suburbanite. I loved growing up on a dairy farm and miss the wide open country. Although it’s still weird to me to live so close to neighbors, the convenience of being in a city where things are open after 5:00 and @joann_stores is a short drive away is definitely a perk.

Now I’d love to know...Any other talented sleepers out there? Share a room growing up? Board gamers? Share below!

savjimenez-1881460024125906554.info,"I got a lot of questions on my post about living a life based on food fears, and how I got past that. While it was a long process and there is no simple fix, I wanted to share a few things that really helped me get out of that mindset.
•
1️⃣) No black & white mentality- I used to think that if I had a piece of chocolate at night that my whole day of clean eating would be ruined. I would never indulge because I thought it was either 100% clean or nothing, which is such an unhealthy way to think! Now I allow myself to have chocolate, or whatever I'm craving, because I know I eat healthy most of the time. This prevents bingeing as well!
•

2️⃣) Don't discriminate certain food/foods- I would get the biggest cravings for things that I all of the sudden told myself I couldn't have. Bread, donuts, bread, wine, even BANANAS (because I thought it was too sugary, omg...) I wouldn't have a craving for these things normally, but since they were completely off limits they became extremely desirable. Instead of saying ""I can't ever have bread"" tell yourself you can have it a couple times a week and that's still part of a healthy diet.
•

3️⃣) Don't seclude yourself- I would constantly skip events, meet-ups with my friends and even some family functions because I was afraid of being around normal food. I was afraid of messing up my diet because I was so worried about eating clean all of the time. Those times won't make a difference in your body and also going out to a restaurant/event is going to be part of your life. You can learn how to eat healthy out and also indulge when you want! It's better than missing your family, friends and experiences of life!

Maybe it's because he is my first born? Maybe because we're now 1 year closer to him moving out for college? Maybe because his face + body thinned out leaving behind no more traces of my chubby baby rolls? Maybe because he was with me during the most confusing time of my life as I was transitioning to motherhood? Maybe because I fear this may be the year he suddenly decides he's too cool for my hugs, kisses, and hand holding in public? I don't know how to handle my feelings this time of year and yes I do realize he's just 7! Then again time flies and my mom brain has a habit of wondering way further than it needs to 😭. Okay that's it. If you need me I'll be hiding in my stories reliving some old memories. Happy Birthday my #Austincado!🎉😆🎂 #motherhoodunplugged #honestmotherhood #momlife #birthdayboy #momblogger 👩🏻‍💻

aaronchisholmnz-1902192297585777098.info,"Tonight I got the awesome opportunity thanks to @hoytsnewzealand to see an advanced screening of Bohemian Rhapsody at the new Hoyts EntX cinema in #Christchurch.

I can't even begin to explain how good it was. I was thoroughly impressed (as was the whole cinema) and it gave a much better insight into Queen's music than I had before. I highly recommend taking the time to go and see it. 
Along with that, it was quite confronting when the story touched on Freddie's battle with AIDS and it really sunk in with me how not even 20 years ago, contracting HIV was a death sentence. Yet here we are now, with the amazing medical breakthroughs we've had since then that people with HIV can live long and healthy lives but there's one thing they need to do... Get tested.

Seriously, get tested for HIV regularly. It's quick, easy, and completely free in New Zealand! I understand that it's scary. I recall the first time I got tested and it was a nerve racking experience. Despite being confident what the results would show, it still plays on your mind and every minute piece of doubt you have will rear its ugly head but the relief you will have when you go and just do it will be unlike any other.

Slip ups happen and when they do, please make sure you get tested. It's your health, take control of it.  https://www.nzaf.org.nz/getting-tested/book-a-test/

Just imagine for a moment: here people were actually trying to make elixirs of eternal youth and eternal life, and, most important, they were believing that they can transform different things into gold. And who knows, maybe they succeed in researches, but we don’t know about it, and the instructions are still hiding in the walls. ⚗️
Кто-нибудь видел настоящий подвал алхимиков? В Праге есть несколько музеев, которые предлагают спуститься в подземелья бывших алхимических лабораторий и воочию увидеть святую святых. Просто дух захватывает... Только представьте: здесь алхимики пытались создать эликсир вечной молодости и бессмертия, универсальный напиток от болезней, и, самое главное, они хотели получить/извлечь золото из веществ, изначально не имеющих его в своём составе. И кто знает, может быть им это удалось... Но секреты так и останутся секретами, а инструкции к вечной жизни будут ждать своего часа в том месте, где их оставили алхимики, навеки спрятав от чужих глаз.

I’m currently working on a compilation of the best and simplest DIY cleaning recipes I’ve found and tested. They will be out on the blog soon, so stay tuned!

globetrottinggrommets-1869264669614890921.info,"We have just spent three amazing nights in a sleepy fishing village north west of Bali- around four hours drive from Nusa Dua (and my gosh what  stunning scenery along the way!). Pemuteran is the untouched traditional Bali - there are no mininarts, taxis and very little Australian tourists from what we discovered. The landscape differs greatly from the South with large mountains, dry bush that resembles home in Australia and a wind that we haven't had before in Kuta! Looking at this photo it reminded me of what Palm Springs would look like? 
We stayed at @kinaararesort - a beautiful small resort surrounded by quaint bungalows, cactus plants and bougainvillea flowers, and the perfect place to rest after a busy day at the islands. The main reason why tourists come to Pemuteran is for the scuba diving and snorkelling, which is exactly why we were there! I have so much more to share about this incredible part of Bali which should be on everyones must see list 🌴

em_wizzfit-1657493222320859550.info,"On Sunday I ate nearly exclusively “clean” “healthy” foods for my high calorie day. And honestly, it wasn’t a good experience and made me feel quite physically uncomfortable 😓
-
Usually on my high calorie day I eat something calorie dense like pancakes or French toast. These types of food usually have high calories, but aren’t all that filling. BUT on Sunday I deviated from my usual plan. After a savoury brunch with friends, I spent the afternoon trialling a couple of smoothie bowl recipes such as this one 😊
-
All afternoon I ate a LOT of fruit and yoghurt. Heaps of micronutrients, fibre and protein - all the good stuff right? In reality it actually caused me to feel too full - uncomfortably full, and I found myself not even wanting to eat dinner 🤢
-
Sunday was a welcome reminder that what I’m doing works well for me. It’s ok for me to eat my pancakes or my French toast once a week. It’s ok to enjoy honey or maple syrup or whole milk or cream. These foods aren’t “bad” when you put them in the context of my overall, well balanced diet. And really, once you’re eating balanced then just eat in a way that makes your body and soul feel good ✌

honeyandbetts-2014636831441915695.info,"I’ll be real; at the end of 2018 I hit blogger burn out for the first time. Technically, it wasn’t even blogger burnout - it was Instagram burnout.⠀
I took on my biggest payday and biggest work load and it took a toll on me. Not to mention, I was dealing with my intense morning sickness and trying to hustle all my kiddos to the bus stop twice a day in the middle of winter. I couldn’t do it all!⠀
This year, I have the power to say “no” to campaigns that don’t reside with me, and most bloggers can agree that those first few years you take on some campaigns that don’t necessarily fit with your brand or your audience but it’s exciting and new so you bend to accommodate. ⠀
I’ve worked with some amazing companies and brands over the years, and I can’t wait to share more noteworthy businesses with you this year. From now on you can expect less is more. More blog posts to help moms, especially new mothers, find themselves in the bustle of motherhood. To share cool places in the Edmonton area. To share more personal stories that I hope touches one person and makes them feel not alone. ⠀
It’s already April but it’s taken me 4 months to recover from the burnout and to set my 2019 goals. I’m feeling wayyyy more confident in Honey & Betts’ direction and I’ll just be doin’ MY thing. ⠀
 So tell me: what little things make you feel confident because we all are struggling to push ourselves over the limit to any type of burnout. Post below! ⠀

raisingkarma-1993484145107911301.info,"Recently, I read an article that said we don’t have #friends anymore but #socialisers instead & #RealFriendship that lasts long hardly exists now. It ends with the question - Is this friendship forever?
.
Not surprisingly, I disagree!😜
.
A long time ago, I’d jotted a line to work into a poem later (never got around to it), but that line always stayed with me. It was based on some past romantic relationships & I feel it applies to friendships too.
.
▪️Just because it didn’t last forever... doesn’t mean it wasn’t real!▪️
.
Somehow, somewhere, we’ve gotten very tied up with the concept of anything real being permanent or forever. And that really doesn’t make sense to me. Let me explain it in this context.
.
Thanks to growing up across the country & then my work in different places, I have many different groups of friends. I’m in regular touch with some & not with others. However, I have memories with all.🙂
.
Does that mean the people I’m not in touch with weren’t real friends then?🤔Even the ones who came up to me when I was the new kid in my first civilian school & felt so out of place & then we sat together in class everyday for the rest of the year? Or the ones I cried to about my first heartbreak? Or the ones, who after years of not being in touch, reached out to me during a very big loss in my life?
.
I’ve also had falling-outs with some people but I maintain that despite us not being ‘friends’ anymore, the time we had together can’t be termed as anything other than #TrueFriendship. The fact that it didn’t last forever doesn’t take away from what we had together - the good times & bad ones where we were there for each other. It doesn’t lessen their value as friends.🤗
.
Or the peeps you meet for only crazy parties or movies or coffee... Hey, good moments are as imp! You’ll remember those stories. Letting your hair down with friends is not any less relevant than a ❤️to❤️ talk.
.
Life is made up of moments & no moment lasts forever. But they’re real thanks to the people in them whether they’re around till you’re 90 or not!💡
.
Does quantity of time really trump quality here? Is that the defining parameter of a real friendship? I think not!😊

Hi, I’m Thalita and this is what I look like. No make-up, kinda greasy bangs, and wearing a sweater I’m pretty sure I’ve had since university (that was a LONG time ago).⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There’s a lot of perfection shown in these little squares, and showing my unfiltered and unedited face is kind of terrifying. But why? This is the way most people see me EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The people closest to me and the people I’ve never met. Putting this face into a square box for a few people to see shouldn’t be a big deal then, right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Wrong.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’ve heard from SO MANY people lately that one of their biggest struggles is showing themselves in their social media accounts. Well, I’m here to tell you that you don’t need a fancy photo shoot, makeup and filters. Just show up. Take a picture without really knowing what you look like, and see what happens. That’s what I’m doing...introducing you to my real face. No dog filters or whatever that other magical Instagram story filter is that makes my skin look like I've gona back in time 15 years.

bosschickportia-1845000164928725733.info,"Pregnancy is not a disability.
💜
Society has a tendency to treat pregnant women as if they are disabled, physically and mentally, putting unwarranted restrictions on what you do, eat, decide, say, etc. etc. etc. Absent of any restrictions posed by a woman’s OB and being mindful of bodily changes that affect motion, women are more than capable of safely exercising during pregnancy. In fact if you are like me, a fitness instructor teaching 4 classes per-week pre-pregnancy, you can often continue your level of exercise SAFELY.
💜
Which is why I was completely taken back by my recent interaction with a Boston-area establishment who REACHED OUT TO ME to collaborate on a fitness event. I accepted the invitation to teach a free community Boss Chick Class and also mentioned that I am currently pregnant as a heads up. At that point I received an email retracting the invite stating that there “in the event that an unexpected medical emergency occurs, we do not have the right staff to handle the situation nor do we want to be held liable if such a thing were to happen”. In my response I stated that 1) I have no restrictions from my doctor, 2) I currently teach 2x’s per week, 3) I carry my own liability insurance.
💜
This was Friday 8/4. It is now Monday 8/13 and after several calls to the store to speak to a manager, my email has remained unanswered. Remember THEY reached out to ME!
💜
This is just another form of discrimination. My baby’s safety is the priority for me, my husband and my OB. I certainly don’t need someone unqualified to decide that I’m unfit to teach a fitness class just because I’m pregnant.

manlyskincare-1951648329922636022.info,"Top 5 products of 2018😎
..
🌌For the next 5 days, I will share my favourite products I tried last year!
-5th Place: The Time Revolution Night repair Borabit ampoule by @misshaus ! Have you ever tried?!
..
🌌Don't be thinking 5th place is bad- because there's alot of competition and this product is absolutely AMAZING ❣
..
🌌My skin loooves this. I use the whole amount in one pipette. Seems thick at first, but my face drinks it all up. Gives a calming and hydrating sensation! Feels like I could layer it a million times 😍
..
🌌I don't know exactly what it is that makes it so great, since the ingridient list is probably the longest I have ever seen - SWIPE👀😅
BUT, I will point out some of the goodies on the list: Sodium Hyaluronate, Niacianamide, yeast, peptides and various kinds of extracts and oils 🤙🏼
..
🌌Works like a charm! Definitely buying it again. The product alone costs around 49$, but I bought it in the giftset you see as the background - so I saved quite much and got 2 essences with the ampoule 🕺🏼
..
🌌I must admit, I like it over the popular night repair serum from @esteelauder since the Estee Lauder one smells alot. Smells great, but I definitely prefer products with less or no perfume! This one doesn't have a scent😘👌🏼 ..

lizdenfeld-1885725326081027435.info,"True story: When @caitlinkruse reached out to me to partner with her and @natalieborton for one of their styling sessions (which is now live in my stories!!), I immediately assumed she accidentally messaged the wrong Liz. She must have meant to write to @lizadams or @purejoyhome (two of my favorite instagram/bloggers who also happen to be named Liz! 😂). I assumed because Caitlin and Natalie have tens of thousands of more followers than me that I would not be worthy of collaborating with them. That they wouldn’t value what I have to say or how I style my clothes. Caitlin quickly wrote me back assuring me it was me she meant to message, which floored me.

Looking at someone with 50, 100 or hundreds of thousands followers and automatically assuming they are better, cooler, more worthy than us.

alongdustyroads-1745217271388775291.info,"When it seems like the giraffes have planned a photo shoot... ___

When choosing our first @GAdventures tour, we knew we wanted an adventure. And we wanted to take our first steps in countries hitherto unknown to both of us.

The choice was clear - Africa.

We wanted to see elephants the way they should be - wildly roaming, happy and free. We wanted to travel along dusty roads in search of a pride of lions basking in the shade of tree. We wanted to camp under a giant sky and listen to nothing but the sound of nature (or, as it turned out, farting hippos!). And we wanted to understand a little better, a region which is so often misunderstood.

We found the perfect tour.

We've only been here for five days and already we've witnessed the spectacular Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, roaring at the end of the rainy season. We've experienced two incredible Zambian safaris and taken countless photos of animals we'd known only through David Attenborough. We've shared conversations which have opened our eyes, and we've caught a glimpse of a part of the world which we already know we will revisit.

We have another two weeks, and countless experiences that will amaze and inspire ahead of us. And frankly, we can't wait.

I knew my sisters anniversary was coming up but I didn’t attribute these empty feelings with the date; I hadn’t even thought of it.

trisha.bell-1595491352007464226.info,"I'm 22 weeks this week and you can finally feel our little man moving on the outside. These sweet moments are by far my most favorite in pregnancy! Every day my heart becomes more and more grateful to be able to experience this again.

Yesterday we had our anatomy scan. At our earlier appointments we had a few concerns about this babies growth and heart, so going into this appointment I was so nervous (which really isn't anything new.) After holding my breath for what felt like forever, my Fetal Maternal Specialist told me that he is perfectly healthy and they have absolutely no worries about anything at this point. This week they started watching his blood flow (through an ultrasound of his brain) to make sure that he's not going anemic and bleeding out like Ezrah did. They'll check this every 3 weeks until we are 30 weeks and then they'll check his blood flow 1 to 2 times a week until delivery. We absolutely do not want to risk ANYTHING with him, so as busy as I am between house stuff, Ezrah's therapists, Riahs school, and doctor appointments. I'm just so thankful to have such caring doctors who are truly doing all they can to give us a healthy pregnancy and safe delivery. 
We keep trying to decide what his name is.. but we're not 100% so it sounds like he may be nameless till birth! He already weighs a whole pound! Night time is his favorite time to throw his hardest punches. During every single ultrasound he's always got his hands next to his face or sucking on his thumb! I can not wait to have him safely in my arms, December can't come fast enough! #GrowingBabyBell",1504417412,17871462181152100,"Two of my three kids required weekly MCA scans and multiple blood transfusions in utero so I can empathize with your situation.

I've really learned so much during this pregnancy! Thank you so much for your prayers. I feel good about it so far and hope as the time gets closer to our delivery date that I'll be able to stay calm.

candied_chocolate-1761218944726715775.info,"Here's a shameless selfie to say THANK YOU to each and everyone of you for your comments on my last two posts. I've been getting so discouraged with Instagram, but you guys have just proved that this is all so worth it. So thank you for allowing me to share my journey with you all and thank you for sharing yours with me. 
On another note, I need to address something VERY important. Every time I talk about my pregnancy struggles (e.g. I'm feeling unattractive, fluffy and whatnot), I get a couple of comments saying things like ""you should be happy because you're growing a human"" or ""enjoy your pregnancy now because it'll go by so fast."" So....I want to make it clear that just because I complain sometimes, it does NOT mean that I'm unhappy and that I'm not enjoying my pregnancy. I’m sure you don’t mean it that way but when you say things like that you make it sound like I don’t care much about my baby and that I’m just self-centric, which is ABSOLUTELY NOT the case. People have bad days and feel upset and whine, but that doesn't mean they don't value the life that they have. That's all 💛

sarahloven-1914126956681528539.info,"After my post yesterday about letting go of the idea of perfection, I am challenging myself to share more authenticity. It’s a battle against my insecurities to share photos or talk about what goes on behind the screen. How down I can actually be behind the online “pep”. It’s a lot of pressure to go on like everything’s perfect, especially when I feel like I must put on a good show to keep working with brands.
•
But throughout all of October, I was struggling immensely with my body reacting to everything I ate. I am gluten intolerant, but it seemed that for endless days and nights I was intolerant to all food. I went completely vegan trying to cleanse out whatever was triggering my intense and painful bloat- it would be so bad I looked 7 months pregnant and couldn’t even fit into my underwear comfortably. Trying to get dressed just to run errands was a lengthy nightmare.
•
Normally my gluten related bloat would go away by morning, but during this time period my stomach stayed swollen for days on end. I felt so uncomfortable, depressed, incapable of modeling, and just plain ugly. I literally felt like I couldn’t carry on with my life until my insides healed. With a job based around my looks and confidence to achieve good photos, I felt hopeless. That affected my health more, and add in the general stress of social media and difficult clients on top of that!
•
Now it’s been maybe almost 2 months, and I had the first good day in what felt likes ages. I woke up with a flat stomach again, and my confidence came flying back. I took advantage of it and shot a lingerie collab that had been waiting. But all the while I kept shaking my head, thinking how ridiculous it was that I had just this one moment to feel good about myself. To just even FEEL like myself again. I was too scared to even eat in case I screwed it up somehow. This condition really does a number on one, mentally... and I haven’t even figured out what it is yet.
•
But all this to say- SOOO much goes on behind the screen. I have always been an artist who loves putting myself out there.

Why as women is there this ingrained reaction that we are ‘ugly’ because our bodies are imperfect? You are such a beautiful woman and personally many of us would actually feel better about ourselves if you did model lingerie with a belly, completely  unashamed to just be you in that moment. It doesn’t make you any less beautiful. I always love your posts and your inner beauty always shines through in the kind way you respond to messages. But I honestly think maybe this insecurity is something you need to address in yourself. Why the hell does someone so sweet and gorgeous feel ‘ugly’ when her body is less than perfect? This kind of pressure is exactly what’s wrong with our society. I have felt it so deeply my whole life and I know many women do. Fuck the brands you’re working with if they can’t recognise that there is more to you than a flat stomach! 💕💕💕",happycamperpizza,1542434508,17938026682212549,"@happycamperpizza that’s what I’m getting at with this post.

whitneyerd-1893633644331673454.info,"Mental clarity can be hard to come by as a new mom 🧠 Between busy day-to-day activities and frequent emotional breakdowns—baby's and your own—the mind frequently feels scattered. Something I do to center myself is quick daily check-ins using the @sbtbreathe app 🙏🏼 Even if I only have 5 minutes, taking a moment to breathe and focus works wonders for my sanity. …………………………………………………………………………………………
Recently, I was driving with Caleb on the I-10 during rush hour (I'm sure you know where this is going), and he had a total meltdown 🤦‍♀️ We were in standstill traffic, and I literally could not get off the freeway. He was screaming at the top of his lungs, turning bright red, and I, of course, was crying myself 😭 In my moment of turmoil, I did the only thing I could think of to try to bring some peace to the situation—I turned on a #meditation, and I breathed through it. Caleb continued to cry for another 20 minutes, and I remained stuck in a deadlock, but the tension in my mind and body took a turn for the better. My facial muscles released their grimace. My shoulders relaxed. My hands loosened on the wheel. And I acknowledged that this too shall pass. And it did ❤️ My usual check-ins are a lot less stressful, but this was just one time of many when I've found that #mindfulness has helped me be better a mom 🤱

lizdenfeld-1885725326081027435.info,"True story: When @caitlinkruse reached out to me to partner with her and @natalieborton for one of their styling sessions (which is now live in my stories!!), I immediately assumed she accidentally messaged the wrong Liz. She must have meant to write to @lizadams or @purejoyhome (two of my favorite instagram/bloggers who also happen to be named Liz! 😂). I assumed because Caitlin and Natalie have tens of thousands of more followers than me that I would not be worthy of collaborating with them. That they wouldn’t value what I have to say or how I style my clothes. Caitlin quickly wrote me back assuring me it was me she meant to message, which floored me. I’m sure we’re all guilty of getting caught up in follower count sometimes. Looking at someone with 50, 100 or hundreds of thousands followers and automatically assuming they are better, cooler, more worthy than us. I don’t consider myself some big influencer (because I’m not 😜), but I do feel truly grateful and responsible to every one of you who chose to click that follow button on my profile. I don’t take your presence here for granted. And in case you needed the reminder: I am not cooler than you. I am not better than you in any way. My life is not more put together or void of sadness or hardship or stress. I do not dress better than you. I am not a better mother than you. I don’t have life figured out.

kileyshaiphotography-1799553497253691455.info,"Sometimes there are ideas and hopes in our head that we can’t just seem to let go. We hold on to them because we don’t think there could be something better- we are worried that if we let go we will fail, we won’t be able to pay the bills, won’t find love, do what we love, but what if you put all that aside and asked yourself: What should I let go- better yet- what do I need to let go in order to step into this new freedom?
✨
Not saying you should move forward with absolutely no plan, but the freedom when we step into the presence/love of God is something like I’ve never experienced- I am sure you have experienced the waves of letting go & holding on, I know I’ve done both with relationships, trusting that I’ll get clients, or that people will even show up to the @sdbusinessbabes events ✨
Recently, I’ve come back to the realization that this life ain’t about me. I remember the one thing in college Theo class is that God gave us life in the first place- he doesn’t owe us anything. Without him there would be no mountains to climb, no ocean to swim in, no friends to laugh with, no opportunity to live out your passion: so why do we still so easily worry? God has given us this beautiful earth to explore & has given each and every one of us a purpose- yet we still don’t completely trust him or even care to put in the extra energy to thank him by our words/actions. ✨
My prayer/hope for myself is to be so recklesslessly in love with Jesus that I STOP stressing about every little thing and that as long as I am living a life in a way that brings life to others, and light to him then - we Gucci. Anyone wanna be my accountability buddy? ✨
So I want to ask you again, now with the reminder of the greatest of the man upstairs: what do you need to let go? Is it the worry that you’ll never find love? Is it a friend ( romantic or not) who isn’t a friend but you stay friends with them because you have history?is it the fear of starting a business that you know won’t be as financially stable, but will be more fulfilling? or if you are like me: the worry that I won’t be ever able to afford my dream dog ( Bulldog) due to medical costs alone.

kimlynchauvin-1868360650938842875.info,"Hey babes, just wanted to wish you all a happy Friday.  If we haven’t met yet, I’m Kim Lyn, the girl behind the camera.  I wear many hats but Mama, Wifey, and Girlboss are my faves. When I’m not photographing gorgeous people you can find me spending time with my family. Today, I’m going to share 5 random facts about me.

Sharing a piece of me is always scary. Don’t leave me out here alone, give me one random fact about you in the comments!  I’ll love you forever. 
1. As much as I like the taste of coffee I don’t drink it because it gives me the shakes and a headache. Instead, soda is my caffeine. Yes, I know it’s terrible for me. But I drink it anyway cause I’m a rebel like that. Haha!
2.  I suffer from anxiety and I’m crazy shy. Those kind of go hand in hand. When I’m in big crowds I want to hide in a hole and never come out. Some people think I’m a snob or mean cause on “IG” I’m so outgoing but in person I barely talk. I’m just shy guys. I promise I’m not that cool. 
3.  I absolutely love to travel but I also love being a homebody. Love being in new places but hate actually flying there and leaving my kids. Love being home and surrounded by loved ones but I get bored easily and want to adventure. 
4. My favorite TV show is hands down Vampire Diaries. I’m not going to lie, I listen to the soundtrack and have cried cause I miss them. You ever get so invested in a show and just want to hang out with them in real life? @iansomerhalder I almost bought a flight and catcon ticket just to meet you. But a friend talked me out of it. @blancandblush when are we starting the series again?
5. I think I’m still a teenager at heart. I love school and learning. Love young love. Dance like I have no cares in the world. Can’t believe I’m raising teenagers.  I cry at my kids sports events because I realize I’m kinda getting old. Yuck. 
Thanks @shilohchauvin for being my Instagram husband.",1536945967,17948140420160576,"Hi old friend, I’m glad to see you’re doing well.. I’m super proud of you. I don’t like coffee as well.

raqueldorsey-1709601235911217711.info,"My first modeling/commercial job since way before being pregnant with Carter - and it was for @Disney! And the crazier part is - I didn’t even audition for it, @Disney casting saw a picture of me from 5 years ago through my agency and said, “we want her.” Here’s where I’m going with this: WHAT IS MEANT FOR YOU, WILL NOT PASS YOU. God DELIGHTS in fulfilling the desires of your heart. Even the ones you have long forgotten of. Because He is good. Never stop believing for the best. Never stop believing for the impossible. Prayer and positive thinking have changed my life. Legit have transformed everything! Pray, hope, live in gratitude and give praise for present miracles. One more thing I want to share, many times in my life I have lived paycheck to paycheck. I remember one time after paying my rent I had 12cents left in my account. A sat in my car outside the bank and said, “thank you, God for giving me more than I need”. I didn’t need that extra 12cents to pay rent and 12cents couldn’t really buy me anything. But it was more than I needed at that time and I was so incredibly thankful for it. I laughed cried all the way to my apartment - because God provided yet AGAIN.

⠀
I’ve supplemented with CBD before, but WOW! I have never had such a positive and powerful affect as when using @elementhealth for the first time. And the results collected from my @ouraring support my subjectively improved sensation of sleep. Objective results to support an improved quality of sleep with supplementation of @elementhealth CBD. I consumed 16mg at around 16:00, did some moving around and yoga, and then took another 8mg an hour before bed (22:00).⠀
⠀
After some insight from a friend and a recommended — and highly insightful — podcast, I made a commitment to make sleep one of my highest priorities. (Thank you @teraleet).⠀
⠀
Sleep is the single most effective way to improve  your physical, cognitive, sexual performance. Enough said. But if that isn’t enough, a good nights sleep can contribute to a 30% increase in mental & physical capacity, while chronically low amounts of sleep (5-6hrs) alters a mans virility to that of one 10 years older. There is no supplement that comes even close to the benefits that proper quality & quantity sleep provide. ⠀
⠀
My actions to improve my sleep:⠀
1. Objectively measure/track my sleep w/ help from the @ouraring⠀
2. Start Supplementing with CBD from @elementhealth ⠀
⠀
See the results for yourself. ⠀

Franklin Falls is 2 miles round trip from the trail head. It is a beautiful, well manicured hike that follows along the South Fork Snoqualmie River. On a warm day it’s a nice spot to throw rocks, pack a picnic lunch and dip your feet in to cool off. ( but not usually for swimming as the current is still strong and it’s cold). We have enjoyed this hike for years because it’s easy to get to, short in distance and the terrain is not difficult.

ccandmikecreative-1799025889679750421.info,"GETTING REAL WITH YOU GUYS: Last week I posted a picture of myself and got some negative feedback. I could have felt inadequate, insecure, questioned myself, or even decided to never post a picture of myself ever again. But you know what? I’m doing the exact opposite instead. If you would have told me two years ago when I started this account that I would post a picture of myself for 50K or more people to see, I would have told you you were crazy. But you know what is so freeing? Feeling confident in your own skin. I’m not everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s ok. I’m not a small girl. I’m 5’ 10” tall and I’m a size 12 on a good day. This body has given birth, three times. This body has had the strength to bring a child into this world without so much as a Tylenol. As I raise my children and specifically my daughter, I am constantly speaking into her life, telling her to EMBRACE WHO HER CREATOR CREATED HER TO BE. I constantly tell her not to compare herself to others because “comparison is the thief if joy.” I constantly tell her that when she compares herself to others and thinks - if only I was skinnier like her, or if only I was shorter like her, or if only I could play sports like her, or if only I had her beautiful hair color - she slaps her Creator in the face. It’s like saying - God, you didn’t do a good enough job on me. No, He did a perfect job when He created each and everyone one of us and when you embrace who YOU were created to be instead of constantly comparing, that is where you find confidence, joy and happiness. 
So this is me, practicing what I preach to my daughter. This is me choosing not feel inadequate because of someone unfollowing me. This is me doing what I love to do. So many women  have asked me for swimsuit recommendations and I find a lot of joy out of sharing classy mom-friendly swimsuits with our followers. So that’s what I’m doing. I’m on the blog with all my summer faves and I’m also right here just reminding you - You don’t have to be everyone’s cup of tea and you will only make yourself miserable if you try to be. YOU DO YOU. And remember - you were created perfectly @liketoknow.it  http://liketk.it/2w6gH #liketkit",1528680619,17878453918261123,"Wow you rock !

terryderon-2029205332080834952.info,"I see women that come on my page and try to call every single thing that they disagree with or doesn’t seem to benefit them a double standard. So I decided to post the actual definition since they clearly don't know what a real double standard is. A woman having different feelings about a situation or responding to it in a different way than a man would does not mean that there was a double standard in place. For example the word hoe describes a person that is sleeping with multiple people or very promiscuous and it applies to men and women EQUALLY! But since men don't care about being labeled as hoes and women do women constantly throw around ""double standard"" when the topic comes up when it's really just a difference in how they feel about a topic. A real double standard would be someone white getting off with a warning for doing the exact same thing someone black was arrested for doing! Or one employee getting rewarded for saying or doing something another employee got written up for! So if y'all could actually learn to use the term double standard in it's proper context y'all will present much stronger arguments and have better interactions with men.

Fruit and veg shopping at my local farm shop or farmers' market is up there with one of my favourite things to do - I see it as a mini indulgence as it can be pricier but not only can you find out exactly where everything comes from by talking to the market stall holders, you’re also supporting smaller, local growers and lessening your carbon footprint - the shorter the transport distance from field to fork, the lower the carbon emissions.

Oakley is Oakley and we all know that. His biggest struggles were off leash reliability/impulse control. He’s got amazing off leash skills now.
Tucker (muzzled) can have a short fuse and little patience with other dogs and occasionally gets over aroused in play.
Ellie @elliewiththeblueeyes struggled with leash reactivity, off leash reliability, lack of confidence, social skills, and impulse control.
Hazel @hazelnut.thecavapoo struggled with off leash reliability, focus, responsiveness and lack of confidence.
Jax @jaxonthehill struggled with impulse control, leash reactivity, and arousal issues.
.
Every single dog is a different journey and their journeys aren’t over. Oakley and Ellie can now be reliably off leash. They respond quickly and offer check-ins and successfully come away from distractions such as other dogs etc.
Hazel was off leash today and repeatedly offered attention, came right when I called and confidently greeted Jaxon.
Jaxon successfully was able to be integrated into this group. (He had previously only met Oakley) his first intro with Ellie was awkward but because of my timing and close management, they were able to quickly get to know each other properly.
Jax and Ellie worked on being able to hangout around each other and I let them get little tastes of playing and then asked them to calm down shortly after.
Tucker and Jax had never interacted either (which is why tuck is muzzled). Because they both have arousal issues, I decided to not allow them to entertain playing with each other. But I was able to successfully have them meet and interact. A lot of the success of this is due to an enriching environment along with timing of rewards/corrections/redirections. 
Most of our hike was designated to walking calmly together as a group and practicing impulse control. Jaxon was able to successfully watch the other dogs run without losing his cool.
It’s hard to explain how the entire thing went, but the end was successful and that’s what matters! Here’s to making good dogs, better dogs! 🙌",1547069599,17921626135267694,Love all the work you do!  What do you recommend if a dog suddenly starts hiding for hours?  My mom watches my dog everyday 2-7 at her house while I work.  Ever since december my dog will hide in a dark spare bedroom unless its feeding time or walk time.  She wont cuddle on the couch in livingroom anymore. And walks scared with tail down.

🥥Eat; i’m going to order whatever the hell I want because I don’t need some kind of permission or reason to eat the things that I want but maybe I don’t need all three entrées and 3 orders of fries. ⠀

🌼Walk; and leave my phone behind. I know that may not be safe but when I go outside without my phone- with just my animals and sunglasses- I focus on the sky and the trees and the birds, more than I focus on the problems I’m having or what-the-fuck everyone else is doing. ⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

⠀
I didn’t press send. Actually, I didn’t even type it. But I did stare at my phone, looking at a photo of him, and I said it aloud. Three times. I felt like a fool the first time, and the second time, I realized it was true. The third time I said it, I felt like a fool again. I wasn’t sure where things were headed, but I still had hope. Looking at his face on a screen made me remember his eyes, his voice and the way he made me laugh. And it made me miss him…bad.
⠀
But then I found out about her. When I kissed him goodbye at the airport, I never imagined his lips would be pressed against another woman’s just days later. And there it was, a harsh dose of reality. He was too much of a coward to tell me he had someone else lined up right after me, and I was dumb enough to believe that he was busy and without phone service. But I guess that’s just dating in the digital age, and I should be used to it by now. And if a guy is posting a photo of his new bae’s ass on his Instagram account, I see no problem talking about my feelings on mine. Maybe we shouldn’t let it all hang out. But we do.
⠀
Love can knock us down like a nasty fall, but every time it does, we manage to recover. Maybe we’ll use better judgement the next time and learn from our mistakes, but even when we’ve been deceived, we find a way to trust again. It takes longer for some wounds to heal, and it feels like an eternity when you’re going through it, but we always bounce back. Sometimes even stronger than before. I’m still a little bit jaded, but hopeful that someone who truly appreciates all that I have to offer, including the craziness, is out there. Maybe we’ve already met, maybe not, but heartache often leads us to clarity, which is honestly a pretty good path to be on. I don’t really know how that works, but it’s kind of incredible that some little part of our heart always regenerates and allows us to start from scratch. Love can be the worst of nightmares, but it can also be the most beautiful of dreams. And we get to choose.",1548130719,17993923636156737,"Matters of the heart are always so crazy, because when it's wonderful there's truly no better feeling but when it goes bad we wish we had never stepped into the situation at all. I ended a nearly 4yr relationship about a year ago and am still recovering and trying to heal. She was blindsided a bit but ultimately I knew we had run our course and I didn't feel it fair to either of us to go on. I'll always have caring feeling for her and wish her nothing but the best but it was still so difficult.

leotielovely-1716948666362389028.info,"Last week when I was in London, I met Marvi from @lostinsamsara at their stall in Spitalfields Market. My morning had been kind of off kilter for a number of reasons, and with vulnerability, I'd shared the reality with her via text in excuse of my tardiness. When I arrived, Marvi greeted me with a smile and a warm hug. It was a quick interaction but so genuine, it reset my day. This is how 'business' ought to be, and her kindness mirrors in many ways the heart behind @lostinsamsara's creation and existence. ‘Samsara’ is a Sanskrit word referring to the ""cycle of aimless wandering and mundane existence"" we often find ourselves in. Catching us in a whirlwind that doesn’t allow us to be conscious of the impact we have on our planet. Marvi and her business partner Aleissa have curated a collection of (mostly) upcycled products which empower the people who make them, this wallet (pictured) looks and feels like leather, but it is in fact made of recycled tyre and cotton, making it vegan-friendly, ethical and sustainable, a green gal / guy's holy trinity. You'll find their collections via the link in @lostinsamsara's profile, worth perusing if you’re in the market for jewelry or accessories of the Zero Waste variety. .

offtheclocknurse-1881575196014344108.info,"It's been 11 years since I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis.  UC is an autoimmune disease that causes my lower intestines to attack itself creating ulcers that line the mucosa.  It is a type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which is in the same category as Crohn's Disease. .
.
Researchers still aren't sure what causes UC.  I am the only one in my family that has the diagnosis.  Currently it is under control because I take 4 big pills a day, but will get stabbing stomach pains when it flares up bc of something I ate or stress.
.
.
When I have an exacerbation I will have to take steroids for the inflammation and my doctors tell me to try and reduce my stress... ha! I'm an OR nurse, stress comes with the job!
.
.
Traveling with UC can be difficult at times, but I don't let it limit me.  With the history of both my grandfather's dying from colon cancer and this UC diagnosis, I have about a 75% higher chance of getting colon cancer than the average person.
.
.
This means nasty colonoscopy preps every 2 years for the rest of my life and fighting with my insurance company over what they will cover.  So be thankful for your health, but also remember to get your check ups too!

He now enjoys snacking from time to time. I’ve been finding it hard to find nutritious snacks for him. I prefer making all his food from scratch since it makes me feel better knowing exactly what’s in them. .

katekagood-1691726759475500734.info,"I’ve had the thought for the last couple of months (it’s going to sound so morbid but stay with me), ‘Life is miserable enough as it is.’ What I mean is, life, at some point, is going to be miserable for everyone. Life does a great job of making things complicated, hard, stressful, and at making you feel bad about yourself. My point is, if life does that all by itself, without the help of anyone… why would you add to anyone’s misery, ever? Don’t worry – if there is someone you don’t like, no need to bash on them and make them feel even worse about things because life is already going to do the job for you. And because life can really just take it out of people, wouldn’t we want to just bolster people up? Then, I went and saw THE GREATEST SHOWMAN (❤️😍🎵❤️) and it solidified my thoughts. Aren’t we all “freaks” in some way or another? We are not perfect, we all have secrets, insecurities, and things we wish we could change. Instead of beating ourselves down (and taking those around us down too), I want to work more on building people up. I have been thinking of my New Year’s Resolution, and though I don’t really like resolutions because I’d like to think I’d do these things regardless, my goal is to work on gossiping less, even to a degree of bashing celebrities who don’t even know I exist (“her dress is disgusting…” as I sit in pj’s and judge). I am going to try to see the good in people and to stop talking (and reading) so much crap.

melindawood__-1811927621413852560.info,"What would you do differently, if fear didn’t exist?
-
We all have fears, some of us more than others. Maybe it’s a fear of failure, or worrying about what people think. The uncertainty of change, or fear of rejection? But what would your life look like, if that fear didn’t exist? Maybe you’d try that group fitness class, or enter the weights section of the gym, hire a personal trainer? Maybe a career change, or ditching that loser boyfriend, a move to a new city? How would you ever know what could possibly lie ahead, if you never face that fear and just try?
Feeling the fear and doing it anyway, is something I’m trying to do more and more in life. It’s not easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is.
What’s something you’d like to try, but fear is holding you back? Or even better, what’s a fear you’ve overcome that turned into something amazing? I’d love to hear it.
-
* I highly recommend listening to @melrobbinslive talk about her ‘5 second rule’, either on YouTube, podcasts, or audible book to hear her story on facing her fears and transforming her life. It may just change yours ❤️.

The Unicorn Slime and Blue Goo are the two we used in the bath. You can also put them in a sensory bin. Just sprinkle the powder in a small amount of warm water and wait 15 minutes for the slime to set up. Detailed instructions are included in each box. Dominic and Scotty had a blast engaging in #imaginativeplay in the Slime Baff. Turn your bath into a full body sensory experience for your kiddos. Next time I am going to make a sensory bin with one of the smelly slimes! Look for my new Blog Post this weekend on all the awesome products we received from Zimpli Toys. *

Sensory play supports fine and gross motor skills, cognitive growth, problem solving skills, language development, and social interactions. Imaginative play provides opportunities for kids to identify with the adult world. Develops social skills such as practicing negotiation skills, turn taking and sharing. Also, it helps kiddos with their emotional development,  by expressing their feelings through the re-enactment. *

For me it's all about finding a balance: enjoying your baby to the fullest but making sure you are finding time for you. #ad 
I know I know, easier said than done… but there are 3 little beauty-related things you can do to pretend you have it all together: 1) use eye masks to help with under-eye circles (I recommend @Walgreens Beauty Hydrogel Eye Masks), 2) find a concealer you absolutely love (I've been wearing the @L'Oreal Infallible Full Wear Concealer and I love how long it lasts) and 3) Schedule a mani and you will feel like a new person 💅🏼 ! #WalgreensBeauty #BeautyEnthusiast

Sí, sí...yo sé que es más fácil decirlo que hacerlo; pero les cuento 3 maneras sencillas que pueden consentirse en el departamento de belleza que te harán sentir como nueva: 1) Usa los parches mascarillas de ojos para ayudar con las ojeras (una opción son las de #Walgreens que se llaman Beauty Hydrogel Eye Masks) 2) Encuentra un corrector de ojeras que te fascine!

I eat riced cauliflower because it's a good base for herbs and spices (so much surface area!) and a new way to get my veggies. Not because grains are bad. (They aren't.)⠀

I like this pea and fennel cauliflower rice pilaf for lunch—preferably alongside tomato soup and a thick slice of warm, crusty, liberally-buttered bread. ⠀

Did you know there’s ways to increase your odds?

1• Your Family history. The old wives tale of it skipping a generation is just not true. The truth is that if it runs in your family (your mom, yourself, your siblings, etc.) then your likelihood is much higher.
2• Diet and lifestyle. Women with higher BMI are more likely than low-fat diets, especially vegan or vegetarians. Women who consume meat and dairy are more likely also.
3• Number of children you already have. The more children you have the higher the chances you have at having twins. If you already have twins, having twins again is even higher! YIKES!
4• Your age. Women over the age of 35 are more likely to conceive multiples. Older women tend to release more than one egg per cycle and some research believes that the older the eggs the weaker they are and therefore easier to split. 
5• Ending birth control. Obviously, you don’t want to be on birth control if trying to conceive, but the amount of time after you come off it may play a slight factor in conceiving multiples. Specifically, within 3 to 6 months after is more likely than after the six-month mark.
6• Partners diet. Your partner consuming foods high in zinc: oysters, green leafy veggies, seeds and bread help in greater sperm production and the ability to fertilize more than one egg.
7• Breast-feeding. Moms are more likely to conceive twins because they are producing prolactin. This is a fact.
8• Height. Taller women are more likely to conceive twins, above 5’6”.
9• Ethnicity. African-American women are most likely, specifically Nigerian women, and Asian women, specifically Japanese are least likely to conceive multiples. Western European 1:60, SE Asia even far less, and Nigeria 1:20! (twin pregnancy: singleton pregnancy)
10• Vitamins, specifically with folic acid such as prenatals.
11• sweet potatoes. It is a fact that women who consume high amounts of yams increases their fertility therefore improving the ovulation process.
12• sex positions. Ejaculation right into the cervix makes the journey shorter for the fertilization process therefore easier for two to be fertilized.",1524334843,17921095516086798,"My boyfriend has twins that run in his dads side of the family.

runtritam-1750893843873635448.info,"Yesterday our family visited La Jolla cove. 🌊 We were fascinated by the seals and couldn’t believe how they came right up on the beach by you. It was so cool! While we were there @ashkickn1 and I did an open water OCEAN swim - a first for me. 🏊🏼‍♀️ I’ve been in the ocean before, but just playing, and never did an actual swim. I was worried how I’d react to the salt water on my lips and in my mouth. Well I was worried for nothing. It was AMAZING! The fish swimming right by me 🐠, and getting tangled up in kelp made my breath catch at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. We swam all the way over to La Jolla shores and back, so got in about 2 miles. I love this girl so much and loved every minute with her. She has a way of making you feel like you can do anything, and makes it such a blast at the same time. She’s doing IronMan Oceanside 70.3 this weekend, and I can’t wait to track her and more friends (as well as friends doing Galveston 70.3). Tri season is starting and I’m so dang excited!!

designbylaney-1924113811998792891.info,"Happy Friday from Utah! The surprise was perfect, so thanks for all your kind words! For #fridayintroductions , I figured it was time for a more detailed update on our lives for everyone who’s asked - it’s confusing, I get it, so I’ll try to keep it simple. .
So, Al was working for a company in NC that had smaller companies all over. In July, he started a project at a company in Utah they’d recently acquired. In August, the parent company announced moving everything to Denver in 2019. In September(?), the Utah company offered Alex a permanent job, which he took (YAY). Instead of moving to Utah and then moving to Denver, we’re living apart for a while until we’re ready to move to Denver together...and we still don’t know when that will happen (April-June prob). Like I said, it’s confusing. But this is the new normal for a while, and I’m grateful for any time we get to spend together!
.
My planner brain is going a bit haywire having a move to arrange with little information about when or where we’re moving - so I’m trying to keep calm and not worry about it til we know more (you may know that “keeping calm” can be reeeally tough for me 😂).
.
When we moved to NC, we had ~a month’s notice, and I had to fly back to SD a few times to finish jobs there - it was a huge eye opener for how rooted DbyL was geographically. Thankfully, some of the changes I’be made in the last 2 years have made that less of a worry this time (ie: no more large signage, purposely not entrenching my marketing in any 1 location). .
I’m SO sad to be leaving my home state again, but the extra months of notice are an absolute blessing, giving me time to do the East Coast things I need to and allowing me to appreciate every day in Greensboro! I’m also excited to be in a big city again for a while - and Denver seems awesome (minus the cold 👎🏼❄️). I’m most excited about more delicious food (no offense GSO) and exploring the Denver wedding market!
.
Okay so that’s my life right now - PHEW! So simple, right? Thanks for all your support during this process! We love and appreciate you all ❤️ .

allmumstalk-1842348621846377519.info,"Hi, I’m Aly, I’m an emigrant - actually two weeks ago I became British, but that’s not important as I’m still fighting the usual stereotypes. Well, there’s an undeniable accent, every day I’m asked the initially innocent ‘where are you from’ question, some people are surprised, others immediately start making assumptions about my education, family upbringing and try to find out why I left my country for the UK. I politely reply - it was for studies - i came here many years ago to do a masters programme in Birmingham - but then there’s the other annoying question: are you planning to stay or...return to your home country...🙄 Define home! Why would this matter? I’m raising two bilingual kids who are already a challenge because they aren’t coming from the same society I grew up with, but there’s more to their roots they need to grasp now and in the future. That’s a subject for another time. I’m also a working mum, supporting working mums as much as I can, especially mums who started a new scary project after having a child. 
Instagram is not my full time job (actually I don’t even see it as a job), I do endorse brands that I’m genuinely using in my family life, but I’m also talking about family businesses that need a shout-out. I do like to share more of the pretty pixels, more than my morning eye circles after 3h of sleep. I am also a full time mum while working full time hours when they nap/ play/ sleep/ eat and I don’t have any help. Not because I can’t afford some but because I still feel I can do this. My mum did it, i should be able to do it too.

bedtime.stories.forevermore-1871947812330023675.info,"Dear @jhansenrolli, .
.
I don’t think you know how impactful CLAUDIA AND MOTH has been in my life. I’m 32 years old, and because of this book I was encouraged to submit a manuscript for MY BROTHER OTTO—my very first book that is to be published next March 2019. .
.
You see, when I got my hands on your book last winter, I resonated with the creative-spirit of Claudia’s and her desires for bringing beauty home and capturing beauty using her father’s paint box he gifted to her. That was spring and summer—the warmer months—my childhood. Oh how imaginative I was as a kiddo! Enter winter. Adulthood. No more easily accessible butterflies and endless moments for creativity. With adulthood comes a lot of responsibility and significantly reduced creative spaces. With adulthood, you have to be diligent on finding time to do the things that bring you life—and for me that’s writing! .
.
Just like the moth sparked new moments of creativity for Claudia when it seemed winter would be void of creative spaces, I began to carve out time for finishing up a manuscript I wrote 3 years ago. Winter became much brighter and brought more life-giving moments for me. .
.
I submitted my manuscript this past April 2018 and heard within 3 weeks that @gibbssmithbooks was going to publish my book—they saw something in the story! .
.
Jennifer, Claudia showed me the importance of bringing summer into winter—of bringing the childhood Meg into adulthood Meg. .

Thank you for writing CLAUDIA AND MOTH. 🙏🏻 Thank you for letting me interpret the story of CLAUDIA AND MOTH in a personal way. For that, I give you the biggest of hugs!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ QOTD》In your honest opinion (of those who have read them of course), what were your thoughts on ACOTAR?
⠀ ⠀
I begin this post off with that question because I want to generate a discussion around this book. And here’s why:

I read Throne of Glass long before I picked up ACOTAR. With TOG, it took me some time to get into the story. For me, TOG was something I had to fall into. I got to know the characters more and as the story went on, the more I became vested.
⠀ ⠀
I picked up ACOTAR not knowing it was the same author. I was never someone who paid attention to Authors tbh, I’m not sure why but I generally stuck with the genre of fiction I loved best and acotar made sense (duh lol).
⠀ ⠀
Well, I forced myself through ACOTAR. I honestly disliked everyone. I thought the story was too cliche and I couldn’t bring myself to love it. It wasn’t so bad that I had to DNF it, but not good enough that I bought the second book. A lot of people tell me it gets better so I really should just pick it up and reread it. But let’s discuss your thoughts! What did you like about it? What was the best part for you?

Every day online, no matter where we are, we are bombarded with attention seeking content that distracts us from doing anything productive and I go through phases of being really sick and tired of social media. Some days it’s good and I laugh til I damn near piss myself and others I realise I’ve been swiping, bored out of my brain for 15 minutes. Stuck in a habit. Searching for entertainment that I never find. In those days I sit and think, if it’s bad for me now then imagine what it’s going to be like for our kids. If all the apps we use are constantly optimising themselves to give us constant dopamine rushes then by the time our kids are using screens as part of day to day life (as many older kids are now) then screen addiction could be really bad, a widespread societal problem with depression, clinics etc and I wonder if maybe we need to start doing more to address this now.
I’m hoping to do some research through a poll on my Instagram story about your thoughts about this and I’ll do a blog on it (keep an eye on my story)

Here's the deal, blue light is the artificial light that comes from computers, LED lights, TVs, smartphones, etc. & when we're subjected to this light when we're not supposed to be (i.e. before bed & when we wake up) we're increasing our risk of damaging cells in our retina (ew) & I'm already as blind as a bat so I'll take all the help I can get! 🤓

Benefits of blue light protective glasses:
+ reduce eye strain
+ improves sleep cycle

Nick and Everson went overnight to Detroit last weekend and saw the Lions play (lose to) the Rams. When Nick received two tickets from his (awesome) employers, we originally thought I’d go with him.

I so appreciated all of your lovely comments and messages about the mural and it made me think about how much braver I've become in my home decor in the last 18 months since I started sharing my home on Instagram. Accounts such as @the.kate.edit have really inspired me to experiment and use my artistic skills more. Originally in here I wanted some fancy wallpaper or one of those lovely (and very expensive) wall murals you can buy but we just didn't have the budget for it and so I thought why not just draw something? I'll admit I was very nervous about making a permanent mark on the wall (a chalkboard is easy to rub out!) but I'm so happy with it my mind is racing with ideas with something for our master bedroom we are planning next.

We had the best time together, walking in a crowded Venice, having spritz at @serra_dei_giardini and a dinner at my place together with my family. We enjoyed my garden and @thefreakyraku studio during a rainy day, showing her our ceramics and our way of working with the #raku technique.

Flore is a talented story-teller, who found one of her most authentic expressive quality, by filming artists and artisans at work. I met her for the first time in Berry, Australia, during our #chiaroscuro workshop with Anisa & Valentina, where she told me she would have liked to film me and Francesco making our @thefreakyraku pottery in our studio in Venice. 
How incredible is that we were talking about that in Australia,  and some months later we found each other on the other side of the world to carry out this project?
I am so grateful to her for all the amount of beautiful videos she took and for coming by bringing in our home her beautiful presence. 
I can't wait to share with you soon so many new things, about this very productive and busy month that I spent mostly travelling and with friends! 💕

mommyislosingit-1790330536633726784.info,"One year later a lot has changed. And so the journey continues...
.
On the left, May 2017...
I weighed 140lbs. 
I was 18 months postpartum and 6 months since reaching my 100lb weight-loss goal. 
Not only had I reached my goal, but I had continued to improve on it everyday by eating healthy and working out at home. 
I was the fittest I had ever been. 
The most confident I had ever been in my skin.
.
On the right, TODAY...
I weigh 178lbs.
I am 34 weeks pregnant with my 5th child and have not been consistent with my workouts or nutrition. 
My waist & hips are huge, my thighs rub all the way down, my arms jiggle, and I’d be lying if I said I had accepted these changes with ease or love....I haven’t.
.
Watching my body go from where it was to where it is has been hard. Made much harder by the body dysmorphia & eating disorder past that I have fought hard to combat by taking control of my health through proper nutrition & exercise.
.
However, a journey by definition means to “travel from one place to another. Usually taking a long time.” So a few months ago, I took a deep breath, did some soul searching, and realized my journey, the healing that I thought I had done, wasn’t complete just because I hit a goal number on the scale..
.
As I look at my two pictures, I admit to missing the way I looked last year, I admit to not loving my picture from today. But what I can say, is that grace is a beautiful gift, one that I am choosing each day to extend to myself when I feel the negative self-image voice start to become louder..
.
By extending that grace, I am learning to above all else appreciate the skin I am in. It’s mine. It’s given life to four almost five children. And that is something that through it all I have never taken for granted or felt less than thankful for the opportunity to do with my body..
.
I am looking forward to the postpartum process ahead, but for the first time in a pregnancy I am not counting down the seconds for it to begin. I am soaking these last few weeks in and trying to savor each day, knowing that tomorrow will come and I’ll have the opportunity to get “my body”...that body on the left, back when the time is right.",1527644053,17859381862254438,"Seriously, u look amazing and your body made 5 kids.

1 tbsp margarine

her.nourished-1912011780668740774.info,"I’ve had so many questions about “how I lost the baby weight”.
.
Like you, I’ve struggled with body image. There was also a time when trying a new diet was a weekly thing. And to go deeper for anyone new here, I struggled with disordered eating at high school and in my early 20s (I’m now 31 😱🙈) - something I’m super open about sharing because I want women to know you CAN shift your focus from weight loss and dieting, and it really is a wonderful place to be.
If anyone gets that desire to try the next diet in hope of it making your life transform, I do 🙋🏼‍♀️ but I also know the transformation never happened with a just a diet and weight loss doesn’t cure a negative body image🙅🏼‍♀️
.
So to answer your questions, I haven’t lost the baby weight. In fact, I have no idea what my weight is right now. I fit some of my “pre-baby” clothes, but the ones I don’t fit I don’t keep in my wardrobe. I walk most days for #sanity, not exercise. I eat whole foods most of the time because they make me feel good. I eat lollies and chocolate sometimes too, because how damn good are they 🍫🍬
I have an extra bowl of oats at night, even if I’m not particularly hungry, because I’m breastfeeding and the quality of my milk for Leo is my priority.  I workout when I can, which is currently maybe 2-3 times a week for a whole 10 minutes 😜 I prep food because otherwise, just like you, I get hangry and make less-than-ideal choices. Basically, I do what feels good and I avoid dieting altogether.
.
There is a place beyond dieting and it’s a wonderful place to be. If you do one thing today, let it be something you want to do because it makes you feel good, not something you have to do because a diet says so. It could be the exact same thing, but there is a big distinction between the two. 😘😘😘

It’s a scorcher 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m sharing a new #fasciafoods #beautyfoods delicious and nutritious ✅ smoothie to help you rejuvenate after this holiday week 🇺🇸🥂Is anyone else feeling like it was so weird having the holiday right snack in the middle of the week? •
I truly believe the best way to start the day is full of superfoods and organic coffee ☕️ of course – we all need clean, nourishing and nutrient dense foods to thrive in life, balance our blood sugar, feed our brains,  and fuel us for our busy lives. And smoothies are a pillar to the #alignedlifestyle 💫
•
Plus the ingredients in this recipe will help restore your entire system, feed your fascia, rebuild collagen, build strength and resilience in your skin,  tissues, decrease wrinkles, while also giving you a glow from the inside out. 
But maybe the best part is that it’s delicious! With two young kids, sometimes the struggle is getting something into them before we all rush out the door in the morning and our whole family loves this! 
Recipe:
🍓 ½ cup Frozen organic blueberries for fiber and antioxidants 🍶1 cup of organic @lifewaykefir plain kefir for the gut healing prebiotics & probiotics 🍏 ½ organic apple for fiber and to stabilize blood sugar 🥑 1/4 avocado for healthy fats 🥒 ½ organic cucumber for the Alkalinizing effects. 🥥 fresh or frozen coconut 🌱 Sprinkle of chia seeds 🍃 2 handfuls of organic spinach 💫 1 teaspoon of MCT oil to feed your 🧠 🥄 1 scoop @paleoproproducts protein powder 🥄 1 scoop of bone broth collagen protein for skin and Fascia elasticity 
Just add Alkaline 💦 (my go to is @beyondo2alkalinewater 💧 ) and then blend and serve! 
What are your favorite superfood Ingredients for smoothies? I’d love to hear so please share below!

And why is that?? (My fav part...) BECAUSE OF US! Because of the diligent spread of activism over the last 50 years, the pressure put on businesses by consumers towards sustainability, and through the use of the internet/social media to demand transparency in all areas of business practices. We are at the dawn of a new age, an age where it is accepted that profit and purpose are NOT at odds, but work hand in hand in creating a world in which we can truly thrive. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Not to sound naive, but for the first time in a long time I have hope. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I see a way in which corporate innovation and the mission of a collective consciousness can repair our planet and heal past wrongdoings. But our time is limited and we cannot accomplish anything without hard work. We must actively do our parts to create strong, supportive communities and a future of business with women at the forefront (love you guys but we’re coming in hot 🔥). No longer will success be defined solely by the individual. It is through our lifting of each other up towards achieving greatness that we will truly thrive. The hive mentality is what will guide us into a more peaceful, abundant future, with purpose and an end goal of multiplied success. It is more important than ever to find your tribe, your group of likeminded, forward thinking friends and support each other in the re envisioning of a future where our planet is truly recognized as the source of our sustenance, one to be cherished and protected. .⠀⠀
So much more to come, excited to share this journey with you all. ✨ 📷: @john_hook

.
A humbling, frustrating, and fulfilling hundreds & thousands of hours of practice.
and still
So much to learn.
.
And you know what friends, 
in this practice there is no such thing as “right now.”
There is no such thing as instant gratification.
There is no quick 10 min tutorial that is going to make you an expert. .
If you want.. A handstand
To be flexible
To have a consistent yoga practice.
To be healthy
Longevity in life
A strong body
A clear mind.
.
It takes TIME! 
Hours and hours and HOURS of 
practice, commitment and dedication.
And not just for a couple weeks, or months or years...
FOREVER.
It is a LIFELONG practice. 
A way of life.
You have to make it your lifestyle. .
And you know what?
It’s fucking HARD!
.
But if everything we ever wanted came easy to us, we would never appreciate all those tiny victories along the way. .
I’m so grateful for this life. 
I’m so grateful for this practice💙

I did keep two of my fave devils ivy up though as these bad boys seem to grow anywhere!!.
.
Another exciting addition to the dining room are these lovely new shutters from @blindsdirectgb which were super quick and easy to install (swipe for a better look!). We went for the tier on tier style in premier chalk white. 
Of course nothing quite goes to plan in our house and only at the point of fitting did we discover the windowsill has a rather large bulge in the middle.........so the sill will have to be taken off and the bump smoothed out but that’s a job for another day!! #sponsored

I’m at @fiercecon2018 in Los Angeles right now, and this year, it’s all about rewiring and inspiring. I want to say that it’s about reinventing yourself, in a manner of speaking, implementing some measure of housekeeping. Taking stock of oneself. Identifying the positive areas that need to be nurtured and cultivated, and acknowledging which ones must be pruned and trimmed. Whether the goal is to get back on track or to find a new path upon which to traverse. Accepting that the possibilities are endless if you only but dared.

Thank you @catherinegraceo for triggering this trajectory with the mantra, “Rewire & Inspire”. And while it will mean a million different things to every individual fierce female, the underlying truth can not be denied. All things can happen if you simply dare.

.
🔸The Holiday Calendar - a very sweet Christmas film with Kat Graham who is just the cutest ✨It’s a lovely film that made me feel all festive inside, but I didn’t find myself rooting for the main couple. 2.5/5 ⭐️ Watch on Netflix 🎥
.
🔸Price & Prejudice (2005) - still love this, though it’s not my favourite Jane Austen adaptation. It’s beautifully filmed and the perfect escape from real life - gotta love Ms Austen and her happy endings! 3/5 ⭐️ Watch on Netflix 🎥
.
🔸Christmas with the Coopers - a film with a massively star studded cast but still not very interesting or gripping. I loved Olivia Wilde’s character and story line but that was about it. I’ll give 2.5/5 stars for her ✨❤️ Watch on  Netflix 🎥
.
🔸Northanger Abbey (2007) - *this* is my favourite Jane Austen adaptation, though it’s probably not quite as good as I remembered it being from when I first watched it as an 18-year-old. How cute, adorable and funny is Mr Tilney?! 3.5/5 ⭐️ Rent it from Amazon Prime for £1.50 🎥
.
🔸Good Vibrations - a true story based on the life of Terri Hooley, a “godfather” of the Belfast punk scene. This movie focuses on the 70s and 80s and is full of soooo much great music and leaves you feeling really good afterwards. 4/5 ⭐️ Rent it from Amazon Prime for £3-4 🎥
.
🔸 Forever My Girl - SO cheesy but I somehow liked it in my emotional state. About a slightly messed up country superstar who comes back to his hometown 8 years after leaving his fiancée on aisle. 2.5/5 ⭐️ Watch on Netflix 🎥
.
🔸 An Education - now this one was amazing! A story about a 16-year-old girl in the 60s who falls in love with a man twice her age. Full of glamorous costumes and hairdos (I want a full of 60s makeover, STAT) but also gives you a lot to think about. Definitely recommend it to anyone! 4/5 ⭐️ Watch on Prime Video 🎥

thejourneyjunkie-1773396252170290967.info,"What is it with rest. Why as women, do we feel the pressure to keep doing. Why do we measure our success in the amount of “things” we can check off the list. Why do we place our self-worth in the hands of outsiders. Why do we work so hard to prove, please, perfect, and pretend. These are questions that continue to manifest before me. I see them in the books I read, in my journal entries, podcasts I listen to and podcast interviews, conversations I have with my closest sisters. It’s a common theme ladies, we suffer from  a chronic state of doing, that’s leading us further from our authentic feminine power, potential, and purpose.
.
. 
Take a moment to think about that.  It’s a hard pill for my masculine nature to swallow. I’ve been trained in doing, doing, and doing. And you might wonder, but then how do we actually get shit done? Well, we learn how to flow. We create masculine boundaries so we can create and exist in a feminine state. Thank you @petajean_ for that glorious analogy, it truly stuck with me.
.
.
And to lead with transparency, this way of being/living/doing/creating is foreign to me. So no, I don’t have the answers or rituals (yet), but I do have what’s closest to me: the yoga practice.
.
.
If learning how to REST is something you need, I invite you to unroll your mat and come join me for a gentle yoga practice. This practice was designed to access your yin. Your feminine nature. I recommend comfortable clothes, any props you have, and a wall to lean on. To come relax with me, click the link in my bio, you’ll find today’s class under ✨new yoga videos ✨

dangerousbiz-1902665527961581940.info,"Out on the tundra with Frontiers North, they call this Buggy Love.

Before my trip to see polar bears in the wild, I assumed that seeing bears standing up like this was quite rare; I didn't think it was normal for them to come so close to the large vehicles that carry tourists like me around the coast of the Hudson Bay.

But, as it turns out, polar bears are extremely curious creatures, and it's not uncommon at all for some of the braver ones to give out some Buggy Love quite regularly.

I asked our guide whether their fearlessness comes from the fact that they don't have any predators other than larger polar bears, or if it was more due to them becoming habituated/used to the tundra vehicles over the years.

He said it's a bit of both. Polar bears aren't really afraid of much, and mother bears in this part of Canada will ""introduce"" their cubs to the tundra vehicles so they know they aren't a threat.

It's kind of like how animals in Africa get used to seeing safari vehicles around; they just become part of the landscape.

The bears in northern Manitoba are still 100% wild, though. So even though they look freaking ADORABLE when they do this, the reality is that they're trying to figure out if we are edible, and whether they can get to us for a taste!

And when people sulk they sometimes do so publicly like my lil Lottie here. Anyway the moral of the story seems to be find those humans you like and hug them hard and when they need a bigger hug hug them even harder.

You know the movie Inside Out... well remember what happens, when Joy and Sadness are inadvertently swept into the far reaches of Riley's mind, the only emotions left in Head Quarters are Anger, Fear and Disgust. And none of them quite know what they're doing.

It's the latter 3 emotions I want to move away from.

Don't get me wrong I know anger creates action. And the ""system"" deserves every ounce of our anger but I hate to see Mums setting on other Mums.

Fear and anger are lower grade emotions with denser energy. It's hard to create change from a low starting point.

Plus it's the Summer and I want to stay strong and upbeat for my kids. 
I know people read things through a filter so everyone reading this will take something different from it. I'm 100% empathy and 0% apathy but that's also my biggest weakness. Which is I guess why I'm feeling sad. It's hard to be an empath when you feel it all.

I assumed everyone has a little compassion in them, for others and I'm realising some people are all in life for what they personally can get out of it. I've never been like that and I'm not gonna start now.

ohlovelyday-2029492100605147477.info,"This is me 8+ years ago as a first time mom. My severe anxiety started almost immediately after giving birth and it was bad enough. But my postpartum depression didn’t really settle in until around when this photo was taken (3-4 months PP). And I didn’t realize I had it until more like 5-6 months postpartum. I just thought I was doing a shitty job handling things. Then I got really really sick for a couple weeks: extreme lethargy, body aches, joint pain, chills, just an overall feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. And that was on top of already struggling with my mood and mental state but not understanding why. After a couple weeks I finally went to the doctor and after I described how I was feeling he said “I want to check your thyroid.” As soon as he said it I just knew — it was my thyroid. And sure enough, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. 10% of women develop this following a pregnancy. For most, it resolves itself by one year postpartum. But for some — and I was one of these unlucky ones — it develops into hypothyroidism. 
I’ve learned a lot in the 8 years since my diagnosis and have made a lot of progress as well as struggled with some complications (a miscarriage and secondary infertility, adrenal fatigue, copper toxicity resulting from a reaction to my Paraguard IUD to name a few). Hashimoto’s is an autoimmune disease that can make you feel like total shit and has both mental and physical symptoms — it is really misunderstood and I had a hard time finding a doctor that did more than tell me that my thyroid levels were within range and dismiss my continuing symptoms. It took me a long time to realize that I had to do my own research and become an advocate for my own health. Sometimes when I think about it I get angry because I feel like I lost so much precious time. 
If you’re not feeling like yourself, feeling lethargic, achy, depressed, gaining weight or a combination — go get your thyroid checked. ❤️ Can I answer any questions that might be helpful to anyone? Ask below!

Beginning in January of 2018 I thought I had the flu, but didn’t. Shakes, super tired, joint pain, upset stomach (likely from nervousness of not knowing what was happening to me), and then the symptoms would lessen as soon as I got my period. This went on for almost a year... then became more unpredictable and now I’m not certain when or if it’s going to come back. Last episode (which lasts days) was over two months ago. I still suffer major anxiety (which kicked in full effect shortly after miscarrying at 16 weeks) and swear I had undiagnosed post partum with both my first and second (who were born 17 months apart). Doctors have said there is nothing physically wrong with me; my psychologist (whom I started seeing shortly after the miscarriage) suggested the physical effects maybe a hormone imbalance. I did a few rounds of cranial sacral acupuncture and felt more relaxed, but still not sure what that was or if it will come back as bad as it started.

daniellemercurio-1916828323885788787.info,"I’m Danielle. I’m a Leo Sun, Moon, Rising... Sometimes I shrivel up from the intensity of my fire and other times I can’t get enough of the spotlight.

I’m an astrologist and I infuse the psychology of being a human with the spirit of the cosmos and the stars.

If I could live solely off of bulletproof coffee, soft pretzels, Chardonnay and funfetti cake, I totally would.

I’m also a life coach. My sweet spot is grounding my clients and clearing out the  noise so they can see the truth of what they really want. I love helping you have those a-ha moments and discovering your true purpose.

Reality TV is one of my cravings. I’m fascinated by the way people live their lives, even if it’s partially scripted. I can’t imagine God calling me out for watching Vanderpump Rules and thus I don’t follow rigid spiritual practices of what I must do in order to have radical moments in this life. 
I live for guiding people into altered states through meditation and Kundalini yoga. More is coming and I am soul stoked about it.

I also have a bit of a dirty mind and I feel amazing when I can make the people laugh around me.

Some days I beat myself up. I question what the eff I’m doing. I think about walking away from it all. I wonder why I’m not married yet. I think about having kids one day. My body and I currently get along but it’s not always the case.

I acknowledge that I’m never going to be in a high vibe perfect spiritual status at all times and honestly the triple Leo in me cringes at the thought.

I believe in the humanness of spirituality. I honor the base reality of my existence and creating cool experiences from it. I treasure staying calm and easing my nervous system when I get caught up in what I “should” be doing.

I host a podcast called Curiously Confident. It’s not cookie cutter self help like you’re use too. We have fun, talk about real things, and make you feel better too.

shardayengel-1972173005207562199.info,"Breastfeeding is hard AF. This same time last week I was dreading every single feed. Thanks to some pretty bad nipple damage & a subsequent infection, each nursing session left me in excruciating, teeth-clenching pain. None of which had ever happened the first time around with Lily.
——
Thanks to some words of encouragement, helpful suggestions from many of you and a desperate call to my midwife, I got myself on Dr. Newman’s APNO prescription cream. It literally worked miracles and it felt like things were back to normal within 24hrs
——
I guess what I’m trying to say is, if you’re in a similar situation or about to embark on your BF journey - reach out when the going gets tough. Talk to your doctor/midwife, talk to your mama friends or straight up Google everything (like I do most days haha). Breastfeeding is hard AF but there’s a lot of resources out there to get you through those tough early days.

.
.
After falling head over heels into the yoga practice, I knew my evolution hinged upon finding a CONTAINER that would support my desired change, not just flopping around like a fish hopping from one yoga class here, to a workshop over there. This is how I landed in yoga teacher training and this is where my evolution journey began. But since then, I’ve struggled with finding new containers of change. Confused about which training to invest in, what subject matter I want to study, and which teacher to trust and believe in. This struggle bus stalled my change for far too long, kinda-sorta causing my evolution to stagnate, until I said ENOUGH!
.
.
I will invest and train at least once a year. 
I will read and finish my books. 
I will make flashcards to learn the material that matters.
I will sit my ass down in the morning and meditate my self-doubts away. 
I will hire an assistant to help me breathe and tap back into my creativity. 
I will rewire my pain belief into my PAIN IS MY POWER.
.
.
I share this with you because if you’re feeling like I was, trapped on the struggle bus of attempting to create change, but lost AF on the roadway, then listen up babe 🗣👂🏼The doors to my signature, annual program - the Body Mind Soul Detox - are now open!

.
This 21 day yoga program is the ultimate container for change, as it mirrors my evolution and that of so many others. It’s not a struggle bus, but instead a step-by-step vehicle for the change you desire and need. Well, need if strengthening your body, calming and inspiring your mind, and awakening and aligning your soul is your sorta thang.

Until I was diagnosed back in March 2017, I had no idea that this debilitating condition existed.
•
My pregnancy wasn’t simple, I was being sick over 30times a day at my worst point. Medication after medication failing, being admitted to hospital when you’re too weak to even stand. I had no idea how my body was staying alive let alone growing a baby.
Unluckily I suffered for the whole 9 months of my pregnancy. Being sick day in day out even whilst on medication.

I’ll leave a link in my bio if you wish to read my story.

I’ve tried different tricks and products, but no matter how quickly I manage to fall asleep - hubby always falls asleep first! Sometimes within seconds of his head hitting the pillow. I’m so jealous. His immediate snoring often makes it even harder for me to drift off into dreamland, so when I had a chance to try @bose Bose® noise-masking sleepbuds™ (swipe right), I was super excited! Surprisingly, they not only block out unwanted noises as promised, they also quiet my busy brain and transport me to the shore!

Luckily, Timothy took to nursing great; and I ended up breastfeeding him for a little over two years, unexpectedly!
He never wanted to give up the ""bee-boos"" as he called them.
-
Fast forward to the twins being born, and let me tell you nursing two is SO much harder. I had to find a way to hold them so they could feed at the same time. The football style hold was the easiest for me. I invested in a twin nursing pillow (the twin Z or my brest friend are both good) or I would prop two pillows under each arm.

Nursing and pumping is a full time job; but the benefits are so worth it. The month of August is officially National Breastfeeding Month, after a 2011 decision made by the United States Breastfeeding Committee. A desire to make workplaces more conducive to breastfeeding and a concern for children's and mother's health, made up a few of the reasons for this month long campaign. #nationalbreastfeedingmonth

I had to feed her approximately every 20 minutes, because she hardly kept anything down. My body couldn’t make enough milk to feed her that frequently, so I supplemented with formula. After a few days, the doctor and I realized that she did much better with formula than she did with breast milk. She kept it down better, and therefore, gained weight faster (which was absolutely necessary to her survival.) I am thankful for the time I had breastfeeding, even though it was very brief. But in my case, I am even more thankful for formula! It literally saved my daughter’s life. I’m thankful for the breastfeeding consultants who helped me choose the best formulas for my baby after we realized breastfeeding was not the best option for us.

My little chameleons. Keep growing little babies, even though I’ll miss you every time you change into someone new, I will be grateful for every single second I had with that version of you.

I would have no clue where on earth to begin. It's tough when you feel like you have no idea what you're doing and everyone knows more than you. It FEELS like everyone in the dog community has been doing it their entire life and I am totally intimidated by them, but in reality they had to start somewhere just as I did. I didn't get to see their struggle, I just see where they now are. I really like seeing the bond people have with their dogs doing those activities. For now I guess my goal will be to have an ESA for at home (there's noo way I could owner train a service dog haha), and learn and grow with that dog as much as possible. Gotta see where things take me I guess. I have dreamed about breeding for a while, but I'd want to do everything 100% right and I know it would take me years to get there, it's likely to never happen so I will admire from afar. c: I have disabilties and anxiety is definitely part of it, to the point where I am scared to initiate conversation, so even typing these messages I was telling myself 'Why on earth did you do that, is there a delete button?!

freudandfashion-1723440181963291916.info,"How to set boundaries without disappointing others?? 🤔 That's a tough one, but if you're too worried about disappointing other people, then it's time to shift your mindset to prioritize your own needs, sanity, and wellbeing. This is especially hard if you're in school, training, starting a new job, tend to be the family member everyone relies on, etc. There's different ways one can learn to set boundaries and one technique I like to use is to weight the risk/benefit of taking a certain action.

Here's a work example: Patient arrives late for appt. If non-urgent, I can either A) Let them know they only have a few mins since they were late so I can stay on time with my schedule; or B) Say nothing about tardiness, spend the full appt time, thus making my other patients wait, thus causing me to leave the office late, thus making me irritable when I leave work, thus causing my patients to feel they can arrive late all the time without repercussion.

Here's a non-work example: Friend wants you to help them move, but you have NO time. Since your friendship is really important to you and you want to help out, the risk of helping the whole day = you fall behind on other prioritized tasks. Benefit of helping = you feel good about helping your friend and spare the guilt of not helping. Therefore, you can set a boundary by saying you'll help for a few hours, but have to leave at a SPECIFIC TIME -- that way you establish the time boundary and won't feel as guilty about leaving.

Well, those were just a few quick examples. I need to write a blogpost on this so I can elaborate further! If YOU have any tips or comments about setting boundaries, drop a comment below!! 👇 📷: @justinhphotos",1519670101,17849468623246557,"I’ve had clients who miss appointments/show up late and request that I call them the day before or day of to remind them of their appointment.

I do admit I have done it in the past, for one specific client, however as I gain more experience in the field I feel more confident telling me clients I’m sorry but that is not something we practice in our office, and I try to offer other suggestions as to how the client can make their appointment on time.",lori.cc,1519691629,17896323607173739,@freudandfashion thank you for your response!

mommyislosingit-1693985298277914212.info,"14 week baby bumps with my second baby & now my fifth!🤰🏻The difference is obvious, but what you can’t see in a picture is one is of a very sick mom-to-be and the other is of a mom-to-be who wants nothing more than to deliver a healthy baby from a healthy body!.
.
Instagram has always been a fun, happy place to share my journey, but in the last few weeks I have had quite a few messages claiming that my focus is not on my baby-to-be, but my weight which makes me sad! So for anyone who doesn’t know what my WHY was when I started this journey, it was that baby boy growing in belly #2 who was born at 35 weeks because I had gestational Diabetes that was self caused! Yes, some women just get it...I was NOT those! My weight (morbidly obese), the food I ate, my lack of exercise, the binging, etc. all played its part! My body was not well and couldn’t carry him to full-term!.
.
So when people write me messages claiming my working out is harmful to my baby or to my body I am just curious if they have walked in my shoes.
.
Were they there when my son was placed in my arms and I held him for what felt like 2 seconds before I heard his lungs collapse in his chest, were they there when I was told he was not only being Angel lifted to a NICU but that his condition was so dire they had a neonatal respiratory team on the way because time was not on our side to get him there to be intubated, were they there when my baby was released but unable to eat on his own, were they there when at age three he was still trying to catch up due to the developmental delays he had. The simple answer is NO! But that is my story and my WHY! That boy saved me!.
.
I don’t usually address these types of messages or comments, but they have hurt my heart each time I read them.
.
My intentions are 100% about maintaining a healthy home for this little number FIVE to grow in and for her to be born strong & healthy. I can’t guarantee that, but it’s my hope and prayer!.
.
So anyone who thinks my motivation is the scale, my size, bouncing back...think again...it is my CHILDREN. A healthy Mama in body and mind for the ones here now and the one to come in July! #transformationtuesday",1516158805,17845280914232237,Obviously people who feel this was must know “know” you or haven’t followed you for a while.

theflyingfitfoodie-1779973882770848478.info,"❓One of my most frequently asked questions is about how I meal prep when it comes to my trips. If you’re trying to watch what you eat or save money there are a couple of tricks I’ve learnt to make both of these a little easier when travelling. ✈️➡️
-
❌Firstly check if your destination allows you to bring in fresh food, otherwise you will be wasting your time and could potentially face hefty fines if you don’t declare it (USA, Australia,South Africa are no-gos for fresh items)
-
✅Pick foods that travel well - fruit in its skin like bananas and oranges are perfect just make sure they are protected from being squashed!
-
🍫Snacking bars - I never go away without a one! Protein bars are great  on the go snacks but pick wisely - most “healthy” breakfast and protein bars have stacks of hidden sugar.
-
🥗Prepping - it’s easy to pre make a salad but leave the dressing out until you’re ready to eat it to stop it from going soggy.
-
🥑I often take a small hass avocado with me on my flights to add to my salad if I don’t have a dressing (or if it leaked inside my bag, which often happens!)🙈
-
❓Do you have any neat little tips and tricks for healthy eating when you’re on the road or flying? I’d love to hear them!😊

lilmissmaz-1968452372506178659.info,"Lately I've started to see a trend. I often hear how a lot of people feel that seeing models and influencers on social media can make some feel  bad about themselves. 💕
Seeing perfect lives and perfect bodies online can cause some to compare their own lives and bodies. 💕
Remember that what you see online is what people want to share. When you see successful people, you don't often see the late nights, sweat, hard work and sacrifices behind the scenes. 💕
When you see the perfect bod you hardly see the hours of training, the dieting, food and body struggles they have. You don't see the 473627 shots it took to get that perfect ""instaworthy"" shot. Even those that have what we think is the ""perfect bod"", can still have body issues, confidence issues, insecurities and struggles we don't know about.
💕
We all struggle in our own ways. There is not a person on this planet that hasn't struggled or doesn't have some sort of insecurity. Remember that we are all fighting our own battles. Some people are better at masking it than others. Some pick themselves up quicker. Struggles are what forces us to grow and learn. The strongest people are often the ones with the most scars.
💕
Not too long ago, I hit a very low point in my life. I struggled for months... I can even say that I hit depression. It wasnt just one aspect of my life that failed, it all came down like a domino effect.
💕
I appreciate those that noticed who reached out. Thankfully I've picked myself up. I slowly had to relearn how to love myself truly again. I will be honest by saying life can be hard at times. Things happen outside of our control. It really is a matter of how we choose to react to things. 💕
So here's a shot of me with my non perfect bod. The one thing that kept me sane was that I didn't give up on training. It has always been my outlet. The endorphins that give me my natural high. 💕
Happiness isn't about life being perfect it's all stemmed from our thoughts. It is found within. Focus on the good, let go of negative thinking. So please don't compare yourselves to others. You never know what battle someone else is fighting. 💕

You have to believe me  When I say this you look amazing during comp and after... is just you have to remember those drastic measures you took during completing... real life you couldn’t live that crazy strict lifestyle all the time because it would be extremely unhealthy... so you went back to your healthy life style which you will put on some weight and fast so it’s just because your eyes aren’t used to it... but you have to know you still look amazing ... most women would die for no cellulite and a flat tummy like yours! You still have great muscle tone! It’s just because your eyes are making you not feel comfortable but you look amazing and don’t forget that!

lizatripsget-1959553186637632623.info,"Continuation: (🇷🇺 чуть ниже) well, the ticket was sorted but what about the rest? In my mind, I was already camping in a tent next to a villa of George Clooney, as I was sure I wouldn’t be able to pay thousands for a luxury resort. However, I was pleasantly surprised that there were plenty of affordable self-catering apartments and B&Bs in Seychelles and actually there are way more tourists that are on a budget than celebs and ultra-rich people. Why does nobody talk about that? Of course, our apartments weren’t lavish, but they were huge and the location was perfect! We stayed 3 days on Praslin and 2 days on Mahe and we spent around £500 for 5 nights during the most expensive season in Seychelles. Besides, the apartments were even bigger than our flat in London 😂🐵

Конечно, билет был не самый удобный (а как же описать вылет из Лондона в Амстердам, из Амстердама, но бюджетному коню в зубы не смотрят, поэтому «Прорвёмся!, - подумала я. Ну ладно, с двумя пересадками долечу, а вот что делать дальше? Ведь я действительно купила билет, даже не посмотрев, сколько на острове стоит жилье. Может, все же придётся продать почку? Ну или придется ехать со своей палаткой? Поставим палатку рядом с виллой Джоджа Клуни. Однако все оказалось не так плохо, как я думала. На Сейшелах куда больше бюджетных апартаментов, чем люксовых отелей, а все пляжи, даже отеля Four Seasons, открыты для публики! Несмотря на то, что ехали мы в самое дорогое время, мы сняли апартаменты на 3 дня на Праслине за 270 фунтов, а на Маэ за 220 фунтов за 2 дня. Это, разумеется, были обычные квартиры внутри вилл, но местоположение было хорошее, было чисто, а места было больше, чем в нашей Лондонской квартире. Ещё и убирали каждый день 😊 в Лондоне уборщицы частенько берут в час столько же, сколько я зарабатываю за полдня, работая коммерческим специалистом в корпорации (особенно если нанимать их через Taskrabbit), поэтому такую роскошь в Лондоне мы себе позволить не можем и убираем квартиру самостоятельно 😂 #seychelles #сейшелы",1547816964,17949347092227287,thanks for sharing this tip!

I'm working on it and am getting good at using my tools and resources for when shit gets too real. Long story short- I got some pretty rude comments in my DM earlier this week after being vocal towards a diabetes joke made by someone with many of followers. One guy asked if I was confusing my type 1 with type 2 because I was a ""fat ass"". Other messages included tips on how I should remove myself from the diabetic community and backlash on how I overreacted.  I was rattled because I'm proud of what I've decided to do with my disease.  Four years ago I wouldn't have spoken up against people who made jokes towards us. As much as I try not to listen, an overwhelming amount of negativity can deff get to you even in a small way. So I took a couple of days to rid the negativity and fill my heart with people who matter. People freaking suck sometimes. But I met two elders at the park the other day who melted my heart into liquid butter. And I took the girls' new au pair to see her first WA sunset. And read a book. And listened to a shit ton of Latin music. And as much as I was feeling the negativity, it forced me to remove myself and focus on the shit that fuels my fire.

ashnichrist-2027194273388944609.info,"What did you immediately think when you saw this pic? (Comment below & lmk yams)⁣
⁣
A year ago I would have said ""OMG THIS GIRL IS PROBABLY SO GREEDY! SHE ONLY CARES ABOUT MONEY!"" I would have been angry. Is that how you felt?⁣
⁣
Then I read a book by @JenSincero and cried (HIGHLY recommend you read You Are A Badass at Making Money, regardless of how you feel about $). Jen made me realize that I hated money & wealthy people because I felt that I could never have that level of freedom.⁣
⁣
I've been in poverty my entire life and I felt doomed to stay there forever. I glorified poverty and being ""real"".⁣
⁣
This realization made me want to develop a better relationship with money, so I could have a better future. It made me want to feel okay with reaching for my financial goals. It made me want to make more money so I could buy my parents a house someday. This realization motivated me to make big moves.⁣
⁣
I still don't have a perfect relationship with wealth, but I am working on it. I feel much better about making money than I ever have, and I don't judge someone or think they are evil for being wealthy or wanting to be wealthy.⁣
⁣
I've heard one of the most inspiring women I've ever met (ya'll know her too) say ""I love money"" and it made me realize.⁣
⁣
Money is only a tool. It amplifies who we already are. If you are giving, being wealthy will make you give more. If you are greedy, money will make you greedier. ⁣
⁣
But the money itself is not the problem. It all comes down to the person.⁣
⁣
I see a lot of messages in the Twitch community that boil down to ""Making money is WRONG!"" We glorify people who break their backs for free. We demonize people for charging for things.⁣
⁣
Obviously we don't want scammers and liars, but money is not the problem here. I want you to know-- it is OKAY to want to make more money. It is okay to charge for things.⁣
⁣
More videos are coming out soon about how to make money with your stream. I am so excited to start talking more about this =)⁣
⁣
Want to get started? Read You Are A Badass at Making Money by @JenSincero and check out literally everything @PatFlynn does. His podcast changed my life <3⁣

I know some people may look at my pictures and think she is “lucky”. Let me tell you, there was some luck, but most of all there was a lot of hard work. I come from a broken family, I was on my own at age 15. I have been working ever since and I haven’t stopped. I had 2/3 jobs at times, I paid my own college and when I left I had 0 debt. Today, I’m thankful that I’m able to provide for my kids, that they will always have food on the table and a home to come back to. I wasn’t so lucky. It took me a long time to make peace with God, bc as a young child is hard to understand why you have nothing and others have so much. Today I understand and I’m grateful especially for the hard times. So I hope that when visit my page that you leave inspired not only to decorate but to fight harder, to work harder, to never give up and to be the best you can be! Life is what you make of it, make it beautiful! 😘🎄🦃•

She even climbed up the water slide and went down......I don’t think she quite understood it would plunge her into the pool (it’s ok the OH was there to catch her) but like a true adrenaline junkie once she realised she was fine she was back up the steps to do it again!! #shesgoingtobetrouble

E was my first and most painful c-section. He was born at Tripler in Hawaii and my incision tore open 2 weeks after, etc. 
With M I unsuccessfully tried for a VBAC. I held out as long as I could until they thought my uterus was rupturing. His delivery was definitely the most traumatic as I had many adhesions from a previous abdominal tumor which was causing a lot of bleeds. However, once all was said and done, I healed quickly and was running again 4 weeks later. 
B was by far the easiest delivery. He was scheduled due to my #polyhydramnios diagnosis and previous adhesion issues. I was up and walk on my own in less than 12 hours and healed physically the quickest. ..

I’m currently reading THE WATERMELON BOYS by Ruqaya Izzidien; I have to admit it took me a while to get into this book. It was not the book’s fault; I’ve had too many things going on and couldn’t focus on reading.
.
This historical fiction is set in Iraq during the First World War and is told mostly from the perspective of Ahmad, an Iraqi man who decides to fight to liberate his nation, and Carwyn, a young boy from Wales who is practically forced to join the army even though he has no desire to fight. So far it’s an intimate look at the effect of war and violence on these two men and the people around them. I’m also intrigued by the historical details about the British intervention in Iraq during this time. Definitely a book to check out if you’re interested in historical fiction, especially world war novels.

I woke up early one morning in the ultra lux @mocu riad to take a dip in the pool.

It was the first time I put on a bathing suit since the surgical removal of my 28-cm cyst growing on my ovaries for two years. ""Make sure you don't expose your scar to the sun for at least 6 months!"" I could hear the doctor's orders ringing in the back of my mind.

Looking at myself in the mirror is a chore most days.

There's a scar that runs down the middle of my stomach from under the boobage area to the top of my Virginia ('scuse the euphemism) 🤷🏾 Some days, I wear that battle scar with pride and think of how bad@$% it is to show the healing power of skin -- to be cut open and sealed shut all over again.

Other days, not so much.

I sulk. I reminisce. I even sometimes wish the cyst was there instead of the scar.

Amazing what foolery we utter on this self-love journey.

As I look at this picture that I took on my tripod, it now seems like the cyst was transported elsewhere 😅 but on a serious note, it feels good to feel like I'm getting control of my body again.

Insofar as it is immortal (and it is) I have a small, bright, immutable part in that immortality. It exists; and it keeps on existing. And I add my own love to the history of people who have loved beautiful things, and looked out for them, and pulled them from the fire, and sought them when they were lost, and tried to preserve them and save them while passing them along literally from hand to hand, singing out brilliantly from the wreck of time to the next generation of lovers, and the next.”
--Donna Tartt, The Goldfinch
.
I mentioned yesterday how it took me four days to move on from this book when I finished it. Was it because of a book hangover? Probably. But it was mostly because I had a really hard time rating it.
.
Don’t get me wrong! #TheGoldfinch is gorgeously written, something that I expect from #DonnaTartt after having read and loved #TheSecretHistory (5 ⭐️s). I also thought the characters in THE GOLDFINCH were fantastic – including the many unlikeable ones. The bits of art history she incorporates into her novel also made my heart sing. (I once toyed with the idea of changing my major from English to Art History.) For those things alone, THE GOLDFINCH deserves a full five stars. But what bothered me throughout the novel was that I couldn’t figure out who her target audience was..
The beginning reads a little bit like a middle-grade story. I suppose that makes sense as the protagonist, Theo Decker, is 13 at the time a bomb at a museum kills his mother. But then there’s the foul language and the growing up bit, which clearly takes it out of middle-grade territory and puts it a little bit into YA. But then there’s violence, drug use and more violence which pushes the book into the Adult Contemporary category. If her audience was clear from the beginning, I think I would have given this novel a full five stars. Unfortunately, I have to knock it down a star. OK, maybe just a half-star. It is, after all, a beautifully written book.
.
P.S. Do you plan to see the film adaptation? I haven't decided yet. I'd much rather see The Secret History come to life.🙌",1551027435,17972237203222554,Thanks for the great review.👍😁 I dnf'd this after 150 pages.

I have absolutely no idea how I would have survived the last 2 weeks without him - he jumped so quickly to tend to my needs, he kept me fed, kept me hydrated, let me nap, changed every single diaper in the middle of the night, rocked Dominik to sleep after feedings and still had enough left in him to tell me I am beautiful, that I am doing amazing at the mom thing and that he loves me.

sorsasta-1992760120393419943.info,"""Feel the fear and do it anyway"" one of my favourite quotes that I tell myself when I get really nervous about something. 
I've been on a mission to conquer my fears and I've noticed it's definitely paying off for my confidence and social skills. 
I used to hate public speaking, omg when the teacher would ask me to read a bit of the book in front of the class my heart would pound and I thought I was going to be sick. Even last year, speaking up in front of my uni group left me an anxious mess.

I want to use my voice to be motivating off Instagram. I want to be able to talk about mental health and make a difference off this platform, so I've started saying yes to more public speaking events.

Was I nervous? Yes. Did my voice shake? Yes. Did I die? No. Was I proud of myself after it? Yes.

Work on your fears one by one. Step out of your comfort zone, because thats when you grow most.

Ask yourself, what are your biggest fears that are affecting your confidence right now? ✨",1551775539,18044631445000693,"Love this 🥰 when you’re feeling better, you should come out for a little paddle with me @liverpoolsupco!

. 
Over the holidays I had a giant clear-out, #mariekondo style. Before, my spice shelf (and parts of the house!) was overflowing and in total disorder but now I've enjoyed my new order for over a month 😇
It makes me feel really good to KNOW every single item I own, and to know I have made a conscious decision to keep/own it. And that's not just for spices, right now it's for 90% of what's in our house (excluding the attic 😅)
.
If you want to read the book who's system I used, it's 'The life-changing magic of tidying up' by Marie Kondo @mariekondo #konmarimethod #konmari
.
I only kept the spices that I love and regularly use.
.
I store them on a long wooden shelf roughly placed in categories: Staring from the left and going across to the right: from what I use the most, to less:
.
Chillies and red powders
Garlic granules
Japanese seasonings, shiso salt, pepper blends
'European' herbs, rosemary, bay, mint, resinous seeds (like dill or anise)
'Middle eastern/asian' spices, cumin, coriander, turmeric
Warming spice that can be used with sweet flavours, cardamon, cinnamon
Odd rarities, that's saffron and propolis this time
.
Styling inspo: the gorgeous @marcritz and @panaceas_pantry .
Much love! Sara x

this_father_life-1953259216245867561.info,"👌🏾 What.a.book. 👌🏾 My reading of choice today was this absolute gem by @willjharris123 which I got for Christmas. As soon as I read the first couple of pages I had to fight the urge to keep shouting out YES after every sentence. I had to do the reserved British equivalent of gently nodding my head while still feeling I'm making a massive gesture on a packed train. In this book Will sums up the biracial, duel heritage, mixed race experience perfectly. Being mixed race is amazing, best of both worlds they say, which to some extent is true. I get the fish and chips with the curry goat, the Island and the Kingdom, the Hip Hop and the Brit pop..I could go on... but you also get the lady pulling her handbag in close when she walks by and zero white privilege 🙄. It's an amazingly complex situation which I never really considered until at 21 years old someone asked me 'aren't you confused? do you consider yourself as black or white? You can't be both' ...but despite the:
'you're a bounty'
'you talk white'
'coconut'
'chocolate chip'
'you must love abit of gangster rap'
'where are you reeeeaally from'
comments I am both. Or neither if you want to look at it like that. I am mixed race.  oooooh I feel a blog coming on. Anyway, until I write that blog check out Wills book, it's a must for any parents of mixed children. It will help you understand some of the complexities you may never have even thought about. You're welcome.

I want you, right now, to write in the comments below, 3 things that make you truly happy... can you come up with 3 straight away? 
I have been sat here for about 20 minutes trying to pin point exactly what makes me happy. What is it that just makes me feel completely content?
I tried to nail this down... and so far I’ve got...
1. Evelyn - just crawling around on the floor with her whilst she tries to eat my nose or stand on my head, when she laughs, when she does something new...
2. My friendships- those friends that make me belly laugh- those are moments I live for 
3.- I struggled here. So... i know that working out 🏋🏻‍♀️ keeps me sane, I love food and that makes me momentarily happy, meditation keeps me calm, but what is one more thing that just makes me TRULY HAPPY?
I actually don’t know. Surely, this suggests I need to tune into what’s going on for me a little more- get to know me better... and that actually excites me!!
So yes, it’s quite worrying that I can’t name 3 things that make me happy right away... but I’m going to flip this on its head and make it something to be excited about- exploring activities, things or moments that never fail to make me happy. I’ll update you when I find that number 3. 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
ps this was taken by my girl @chessiekingg at the @benandjerrysuk Scooper club (3 courses paying homage to the new non dairy vegan ice cream range)- now THAT did make me happy! And why? because I laughed, felt confident and content in the company of a good friend eating all the FOOD 🍦😋🙋🏻‍♀️- whole outfit from @asos- shoes from @thisiswhistles",1517679882,17922343045028216,Love this photo!

bethanythislittleestate-1876560611108122518.info,"I could say something really enchanting here about marriage, but these days I am preferring real over beautiful. ✨
.
We’ve hit a milestone today and celebrated 13 years of marriage and 15 years of togetherness. I’d love to tell you we’ve made it because we never go to sleep angry, fight hard or disagree. But the TRUTH is, marriage is the hardest thing we’ve ever done. AND truth be told, we have DIY renovated and gutted two homes together and even wallpapered a ceiling together while teetering on broken ladders. 😉😅😬
.
We aren’t the lucky ones or the ones that love harder or deeper. Nope, it’s not like that. We simply wake up every day and acknowledge each other’s flaws and shortcomings and then aggressively love each other anyways. We know each other’s worst, but believe in eachthers best. Which could sound like a fairytale or a suspenseful biography? ✨🤷🏼‍♀️I suppose it’s all perception. ❤️
.
So often we are shown one side of commitment. Showcased in romantic photo shoots and close embraces, but the truth is love is the realest when it endures the messes. It’s found in the disastrous kitchen that you both attempt to clean together or in the sleepless nights with health scares or cranky babies, it’s found in the neatly folded laundry piles that arrive to dressers or in the bags of groceries dragged home in the rain. It’s found in the “I’m sorrys” and the “I don’t want to fight anymores” it’s discovered in the moments where you look at eachther and you see the person that’s always been your biggest fan. It’s then, that you know that yes, marriage will be hard at times, BUT the BEST adventures, triumphs and accomplishments, aren’t easy either, but they’re way more fun with a friend. Especially when conquering laundry mountains. 😉🙌🏻
.
Here’s to a lifetime of milestones and accomplishments with you @artthislittleestate ❤️ My best friend, partner in business, life, projects-galore and parenting. And to the one that makes me laugh the loudest and most often. 👌🏻Here’s to a million more everythings together until forever. @artthislittleestate ❤️

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1️⃣ I moved to Plano, TX from London (England), not Canada with my husband (and his job) and my two kids, who were 3 and 6 at the time⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2️⃣ It's tough leaving your family and friends and starting new somewhere else - especially in a different country. I found it tough to find my support network and get answers to the millions of questions I had about⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3️⃣ Where to live, what Dentist or Doctor to use, What Schools are good, what Restaurants to eat at, which Hair Stylist to go to?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
4️⃣ I wanted and trusted other Moms opinions and didn't find the resources I wanted online, so ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
5️⃣ I started Plano Moms - a Facebook group, page, email newsletter and website with Blogs, Directories, Offers, Events and more! They are recommended and trusted resources from Mom to Mom. I now have a team of 3 local Moms who support and provide all of these resources⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
6️⃣ Plano Moms has just turned 3. The community is vibrant and thriving. And Moms are getting the answers they desperately want⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

7️⃣ Now tell me something about you!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

jenna_summers-1901134816692447134.info,"I remember the first time I step foot into a gym.. like it was yesterday - Lifestyle Fitness.
-
I walked in and immediately felt overwhelmed and intimidated.
-
After I signed up with the guy at the front desk, he walked me around, showed me where a few things were, handed me a class schedule, and sent me on my way.
-
Inexperienced. Uneducated. and Insecure.
-
So I took a peak at the class schedule and saw a Zumba class starting shortly and figured why not, at least there I’ll get a little guidance. -
After the class I decided to do a little exploring myself and realized the machines had instructions on the side of them. So I plopped down on the seated leg curls and did a few “reps”.
-
After 2 weeks of Zumba classes and leg workouts, I was hungrier for more. I wanted to know MORE about this whole “getting in shape” thing.
-
I remember staying up until 2 in the morning researching @bodybuildingcom trying to figure out the right plan for me.
-
After 5 years of experience, a bachelors degree in public health, a minor in nutrition, a personal training certification, a physical activity public health specialist certification, 1 bikini show, 2 reverse diets, compiled research data, multiple case studies, and over 300 successful client transformations ..I’m more than just an “influencer”, an “instagram model”, or just another “online fitness coach”.
-
Ive been in your shoes and have experienced first hand what it’s like to not know what to do or where to get started!
-
I now wear this smile proud and confidently when I walk into the gym! -
I’ve cultivated my calling. A journey that started as a little self exploration, a lot of insecurities, and intimidation.. has now become a passion to help others discover and create their own journey.

lizbohannon-1881445969440888387.info,"Hi! 👋🏼 .
✨My name is Liz and here are a few things about me if you’re new around here:
.
✨ I’m married to the best man I know. Our love is two parts The Notebook, two parts The Amazing Race and one part Jerry Springer. (We both have BIG opinions and feelings and we don’t always use our “indoor voices” while “discussing our differences.” Working on that 😬🏆.)
.
✨ Being a mom to our two sons is one of my greatest joys. I feel a deep sense of calling to raise these boys to be men who will acknowledge their privilege and use it to create a world that is more just, fair and bright.
.
✨ I’m CEO and Chief Mischief Maker over at @ssekodesigns, which is a purpose driven fashion brand that creates community and opportunity for the most brilliant and committed women in East Africa and across the globe. The Impact Entrepreneurs that sell our (stunning) accessories and apparel line here in the U.S. are called Sseko Fellows and they are some of my favorite humans on Planet Earth.
.
✨ I love words so mega and my dream vacation involves reading allllll the books for twelve hours a day with a one hour break for an ill-conceived adventurous activity that could result in some kind of epic disaster but maybe fantastic story because if you don’t have fear-induced diarrhea every so often are you really living your best life?
.
✨ I’m crazy for community and live on an urban commune in Portland, OR where we share property, meals and life with our best friends. I like to make jokes about my kids and their five dads, because #CommuneLifeY’all
.
✨ Speaking of our commune...some of my friends think I’m a socialist feminist liberal hippy nut job. Oh heyyyyy! 👋🏼
.
✨  Some of my other friends think I’m a little Bless Your Heart naive and old fashioned for loving Jesus and believing some pretty wild things about how we should live life like we actually believe God is real and absolutely crazy for us.
.
✨But I can’t make everyone happy, I’m not tequila so 🤷🏼‍♀️.
.
✨(Speaking of tequila, it’s also probably important to know that I carry gourmet salt on my person at all times and MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS EXCELLENT SO LAY OFF.)

simplyhouseandhome-1881956749859172959.info,First fire as we have friends coming for supper 💃 Back to that subject of Lime Wash ..It’s not easy.. well it is but !! ..it goes on super quick almost clear then as it dries it gets whiter and whiter.  It isn’t a problem because you can get wire wool lightly rub some off going back to the natural colour of the brick.. so it’s actually quite good fun to play with. I have to put some sort of coating on my exposed brick work because it felt too gritty to the touch for me. As the lime dries it gives a lovely soft finish to touch. I think had I used watered-down white paint it would’ve been a nightmare to remove if it’s not right.

foldedpagesdistillery-1958955105102855927.info,"When someone asks you for a book recommendation, what is your top recommended book or author? It’s tricky finding a book that you feel like you could recommend to anyone, but “A Pocketful of Crows” is going on my list of recommendations for fairytale lovers. .
🐝 
Last week @the.bookish.photog showed me her copy of “A Pocketful of Crows” and I was like “why have I never seen this book??” 😍😂Gorgeous cover and stunning illustrations (inside the book, too) aside, the synopsis promised me a revenge plot, which is my favorite. Listen, I know that morally, revenge doesn’t always satisfy or that it’s often better to take the high road… but that doesn’t mean I don’t revel in revenge in my stories. ha. .
🐝 
The writing style in “A Pocketful of Crows” took me a minute to get into. It’s a first person narrative about one of the “traveling folk” (who we often refer to as Fae or witches) and it’s both simple and whimsical. Once I got into the rhythm of her voice, I was immediately taken with the description of what her life is like and what kind of cares she has and doesn’t have. This story is described as a modern fairytale of love, loss, and revenge and since it’s quite short I don’t want to get too much into it. But I will say this— as someone who loves revenge, I was immensely satisfied with some of the writing in here. There was something niggling at the back of my brain as I read this story and as the plot begins to unfold I found that this story also offered a welcome and crazy surprise that felt so fitting to the way of the traveling folk. All in all, it’s an excellent tale that offers so many thoughtful themes, particularly on staying true to yourself. .
🐝 
So in honor of Stephanie’s (@the.bookish.photog) influence on my book buying and reading this week, I decided to try a photo that looked a little more like her shooting style. .

How are you doing? •
So before Christmas, I made a little @cultbeauty order and got myself the @alphahskincare liquid gold serum. •
I have wanted to try this for quite some time, yet it’s always been one of those products that I’d add to cart and then remove last minute - probably because of the price tag 🙈
•
However, this time with it being Christmas and all that I thought I would just go for it. •
I haven’t had the chance to use it yet as I’m still quite poorly and my skin is probably the worst it has been in a long time. So using anything new would mean I wouldn’t be able to fully measure the results! •
However, I really can’t wait to try it and as soon as I do, I will share my review. •

dadultlife-1848490662467734396.info,"How Friday nights have changed... 😴

I was promised two massages by the missus, one for Father's Day and one for my birthday but *TI voice* #WhereDeyAtDoe? 🤔

As a result I took matters into my own hands or, more accurately, the hands of @ac_massages. This was only my second ever professional massage and I'm clueless as to why – especially as I'm so injury-prone. 👴

I quickly realised how tight and knotty my back is, so with the TMNT-style bamboo sticks whipped out, I was given a first-hand idea of how a chef might go about tenderising a steak. Between 792 work projects, regular exercising, hunching over to chase someone who comes up my ankle and an endless list of bills, it was a long forgotten feeling to completely unwind and switch off for a while, so damn it felt good! 🤗

Also, and I’ll talk more about this soon. We ate local, vegetarian food not for healthism but for group preferences and enjoyment.

Just a pair of Balls and dreams. ya , Im not sitting on millions, thats not what im saying.but Im happy and free. I can work everyday and love what I do. I m impatient to wake up and keep going!

I have nothing to prove to anyone but myself ! So everything comes back to me. If i dont work hard, its my problem ! 
My advise ! A race horse doesnt look to the side,It just looks straight to the finish line. I dont let anyone tell me I cant do something. Infact, nothing annoys me more then someone assuming I wont be able to, and makes me laugh more than the one that tries to be like me. lol

Its like a fire inside of me I cant explain. Ill work till I reach my goals with class & respect, no other cheap way.

All of these thing I adore.
I’m over on stories asking you all some questions, and I am loving your responses and i’m trying to reply to all, think about what you’ve told me and process how I can help everyone get their head around more sustainable living.
I understand it’s a trendy thing nearly now to talk about, that i’m new to it and that there are others much further down the path than me.
BUT i am hoping BECAUSE i’m new to it, i’m helping to remove the veil of how bad things are.
🌱
We have a major problem, our mother world is at breaking point and by thinking that throwing our cardboard into the green bin is enough and helping the situation is no longer is valid.
Yes our world is a mess for many reasons, but hiding behind generational habitats we learnt from our parents has to stop.
It’s ok to change, and no matter what you do just start. Please start.
My list is endless but at least i’ve written the list and I can start to tick things off.
This is my list:
🌱Plastic in the home
🌱Beauty products.
🌱Body & hair products for me and my boys (tough one for teenagers).
🌱sanitary products.. i’m thinking @shethinx but need to carefully think!
🌱clothes for teenage boys... is there any good trendy sustainable brands for teens?
•Electric car
•Solar panels for our electric car

So i don’t have all the info (as i’m researching everything) or the money to just change over night, but I’m hoping by 2020 i will feel i’m doing my bit.
People ask is this who I am now... and yes this is who I am and I love her.

My lectures on middle school where about toilet paper, Levi’s, and chewing gum (not even about my cats, and I did loved cats since then lol). So I definitely had an urge to be ‘different’, and I had other interests than my class mates. But somewhere along the way I lost track, so it seems. Or was this track what I wanted? I didn’t finish my university but I liked learning a lot. However I had a huge exam anxiety, and then I just quit. And I never thought about doing something about it, because well I’m raised in a family where you had to be tough and failure wasn’t an option (so I did great haha). .❗️
Before this becomes an ‘looking for excuses’ caption, I know I’m not alone and a lot of people in my generation also don’t know what to do. Could be the same reasons as mentioned above, or could be different reasons. Not knowing what you want can make you feel useless, and insecure. Or you don’t know where to begin, right? All I know and learned is, don’t settle for less and don’t let fear and anxiety stop you from doing something. Don’t let your past define you, and your abilities. And last but not least, don’t be ashamed. Don’t feel like you HAVE TO for other people. Take your time, you will figure it out. 🙏🏻❤️",1537974371,17852624524290373,"Just turned 26, put my university on hold and absolutely clueless what to say when my parents ask ""ok what did you want to do"" ""what makes you happy"" ""what mi s of job do you want then"" ""you can work towards something if you have a goal, so what it is"" - well.... if I fucking knew that trust me I'd be making the steps to getting there.

chasingmcallisters-1924284712990440561.info,"I want to talk about #gratitude. I want to talk about what it means to live and operate from this space, and the incredible power it holds. It’s not just about rattling off things that make you happy (although that’s a great start), but it’s about training your brain to find the abundance and ✨light✨ in even the darkest of situations. •
It’s a practice. It’s a choice. It’s deciding that this moment is Enough and perfect. It’s letting go of comparison, envy and lack. It’s focusing on the half full part of the glass, which ultimately leads to focusing on the half full part of life, which CREATES more fullness, more abundance, more love. •
Choosing to live from gratitude is LIFE CHANGING. The incredible teacher Wayne Dyer said ‘change the way you look at things, and the things you look at change.’ Ive found this to be 100% true. If you don’t believe me, try writing a daily gratitude list every morning for 30 days. (I’m not kidding). Do you have a gratitude practice?

Ok first photo is more what I have been doing for two decades, twirling small sections around my finger before I dry and using products with more hold - what I have improved on is adding my product dripping wet, finger curling and then NOT messing with it, just letting it air dry to probably 40% before I diffuse, seems to make my curls shinier and juicier if that makes sense?  But there is always that patch of frizz at the tip top.

The second photo is what my hair looks like if I use minimal products and no finger curling ""au natural"" but I did diffuse it.  It's definitely not my preference but I like how my hair has volume and the curls stay separated.  However it does not last 5 days. 
Since I only wash my hair every 5 days this is a slow process and there's the weather🙄

laducb-1723472652117884311.info,"Tonto has always been kind of accident prone or at least he has always had a little bit of bad luck. Once we were at the park throwing a stick for then and he went to get it and it shot straight up through his chest cavity and missed his vital organs by just a fraction of centimeters. We no longer allow him to play with real sticks. Another time (two actually) he was bit by a spider and we ended up at the emergency vet because his entire face swelled up from an allergic reaction. Now that he has been sick I have been hovering over him like never before and I kind of wish I could just put him into a bubble suit to protect him. One of my fears now is being too far away from anything to help him if something were to go wrong. If he were to get sick or have a reaction to something in his treatments I want to be close to his doctors. While we have been assured that we should let him do whatever he wants to do and is capable of doing, I have a hard time letting go of my paranoia. This past weekend I kind of wish I had a bubble suit for myself, too. I thought it would be cute to have a video of me running down a pretty section of trail with the dogs and my spikes caught on one another and I totally ate it… I went flying onto my face in a sliding home run move for at least ten feet (sadly that part wasn’t caught on video) - during the fall my water bottle and dog treats went flying out the side of my pack and when I finally stopped sliding I looked up to see Tonto right in my face. At first I thought it was him being worried but it turns out he just wanted the treats that had landed right near my shoulder. Thanks for the concern Tont!

meredith_deanne-1903836594549421975.info,"Slow days snuggling my babe are basically what fills my “agenda” lately.  Truthfully, we’ve had a few rough days over here.  Not much sleep, some sniffles, and a fiercely independent toddler; not to mention some bland weather keeping us indoors, topped off with a pile of candy that I’m not willing to dole out every five minutes - and it’s easy to start wishing away some of these days, or this season of life.  Lately, when I start to feel that way (which I have to admit is pretty often) - while I’m rocking a fussy babe at 2:00 am, or putting my toddler in timeout for what feels like the millionth time - I try to purposefully pause and remind myself that these days are fleeting, and one day I will probably look back and miss this time of life terribly.  It’s not easy, this motherhood thing, but I know it’s probably the best thing I’ll ever do.  So mamas - what’s something you know you’ll miss one day that probably drives you crazy now? I would love to hear some honest-mama moments on here today, so I know I’m not the only one 🤣. #sharingiscaring .

You could hear a pin drop. You could feel the change bubble, and the passion fire. I was so grateful to take a small lecture on my personal experience. It’s always exhausting to do this (imagine doing therapy but with 100 people staring at you☝🏻👀) but it’s imperative, and I adore it. I would like to thank the woman who shook my hand and said ‘you’ve given my family hope.’ These words stay with me forever - a fingerprint of love on my bones.

brokemillennialblog-1876913923287730716.info,"This is probably one of the biggest (financial) ways Peach and I are different and that's okay. Our overall financial goals align, but he feels less stressed about the existence of his student loan debt than I do. Probably because he's been dealing with it for years. He (and now we) does pay more than 2x the minimum due, so the loans are not on the slow burn repayment schedule. He also shaved off thousands of dollars ahead of schedule by himself on a teacher's salary in NYC. I would just rather raid more of our savings to get rid of it today, which is more of an emotional move than a rational one.

What would you do? Pay it off aggressively by raiding savings/investments or focus on other money goals? ▫️

sparklesandstretchmarks-1837255429325090656.info,"I struggle with knowing how much of my reality to talk about on these squares. I’m all for honesty but I worry about boring people with my issues when, let’s face it, everybody has their own. Mine aren’t special.  My anxiety and depression are intense lately. I feel bone tired all the time, all I want to do is sleep. The other night I had the biggest panic attack I’ve had in years, and since then I’ve felt dazed, detached from everything.  Money worries are a big factor. We’ve been getting in further over our heads since my other half lost his job & now we’re teetering on the brink of homelessness as we can’t afford our extortionate private rent anymore.  I’m finding it hard not to blame myself for not being able to make more of a success of writing or this business of mine. I feel like I’m not cut out for it. I did a radio interview about fat shaming this week and was so anxious I almost hung up on the interviewer - I’m not slick or polished enough for this sort of thing, I feel like I have tons to say but I’m not eloquent enough to say it well. Im endlessly comparing myself to other bloggers and questioning why they get paid so much more than me. I spend my days replying politely to work query emails only to find out they want me to produce work for them in return for nothing. Then there’s all the carrot dangling. Last week I was offered a new sofa to review - I cried with happiness because I’ve been fantasising about a new sofa for years. Mine is 10 yrs old and falling apart , and I can never afford a new one. Then a few days ago the company messaged to say they’re giving it to someone else. Which is fair enough - it’s just business and nobody owes me a new sofa. But it’s hard not to tell yourself it’s because they want to give it to someone thinner, prettier, more aspirational, less working class. Just like the people who get paid the better rates.
 I know this is mostly anxiety and depression talking, and it’s all very defeatist of me - and I know I’m so fortunate in so many ways. And that what will be, will be. But it’s hard to shake these feelings off. And to post a smiley fun photo today would just be a lie. So let’s be real.",1533237936,17937319492157949,I completely relate to you!

She answered a lot of our questions about having a child with special needs and talked about the joys and some of the challenges.  One thing that really stuck with me about her visit was how much love her kids had for their brother. She shared a story about how they were writing up a will and her kids started debating on who their brother with DS would end up living with (they all wanted him to live with them). I prayed that one day my kids would have that same love for their brother. Today, I see their love for him everyday and it brings me so much joy to know that Wil has already taught his brothers and sisters so many things about love that I could never teach them.

#CurrentlyReading: ""Good Omens"" by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman 😈⠀
⠀
As a big fan of Neil Gaiman, I think it's about time I got around to reading ""Good Omens"". A hilarious take on the son of Satan and the looming Apocalypse? Sign me up! I've just started this today, but even though I'm not that far into it I am already LOVING the playful tone here. ⠀
⠀
This is also the first time I'm reading anything that involves Terry Pratchett, whom I've heard so much about. Who knows? Maybe this will be my gateway into his works as well, because I know people adore ""Discworld"". That whole series is intimidating as hell though. SO. MANY. BOOKS. We'll see... 🤔⠀
⠀
Have you read ""Good Omens""?⠀
Did you think it was worth the hype?⠀

tothepointenutrition-1952540495345094918.info,"GENERAL question: Do you feel confident about your body? Comment below👇🏼 or DM me, I want to hear from you👩🏻‍💻
.
.
.
Often times, our own self-perception stands in the way of our ability to focus on what we love most. For dancers, it can be difficult to find the confidence to truly dance freely, without concern over the potential for negative perceptions or judgement, especially body-type related. This can be especially tough as we navigate aesthetic-type sports in a diet-driven world. 🤯
.
.
.
I constantly remind clients that despite what you HEAR (in class) or SEE (on your feeds), remember what YOUR personal goal is. No matter what diet your friend may be trying, understand what works best for YOU (or work with a professional- like a dietitian🙋🏻‍♀️) to help. This is key to your success and often times your health!❤️",1546980986,17847151402334467,"hmmm.. I'm MOSTLY content with my body! I'm a tall girl and I know I have nice lines. but because of my height, I'm 'heavier' just by default. Men have trouble lifting me because i dont weigh <100 lbs like a more petite ballet dancer would. if I'm to get specific; i guess my thighs have always been my biggest insecurity. that's just the place where my body is 'programmed' to store fat I guess? I turned into a 'pear shape' once I hit puberty and I distinctly remember the Russian ballet teachers poking me in the thighs and calling me ""jiggly like a jelly fish."" I know in the end, my thighs dont make or break my dancing, but that's the one thing that will get me ""stuck in my head"" once I give it power. I KNOW I'm a healthy weight for my height, I'm even considered underweight for an average pedestrian. but ballet dancers are often expected to be extraordinarily lean, and I feel like I'm just 'average' for a ballet dancer. I feel like carrying weight my lower half makes me look very heavy and clumsy at times. when I was at my lowest weight, I remember a lot of things feeling easier. it took less force to jump, less impact on the joints, light legs lifted more easily in adagio... but i remind myself that I'm not performing right now. it is not MY JOB to maintain that near impossible standard. if I need to lose a bit of weight for a role, I'll do it when I get paid for it 😂 until then, why torture myself? this is what I have to work with. 😎",thesaltysugarplum,1546988283,17912952208279886,"@thesaltysugarplum I will say, from my experience working with companies it seems that there is a shift happening... from the previous “ultra thin” ideal to now emphasizing a more athletic build.

ella.ryder-1794400326779685860.info,"This is my most personal post to date (we shall resume to coffee photos tomorrow) but something I feel very strongly about and hopefully through my embarrassment and opening up it will help at least one person know they aren’t alone 🙏🏻 On the left is me during my second year of university. I wasn’t vastly overweight but I was a lot heavier than is natural for my small frame. Looking back now, I know that leading up to this point I would use food to numb my low self-esteem. I didn’t love myself so I didn’t eat foods that made me feel my best. I don’t remember at what point I specifically started to lose weight but it was a very gradual thing. I started with the usual exercising more and eating smaller portions of healthier foods. At my heaviest I was around 13 stone and I lost nearly 5 stone that way. I was obviously significantly slimmer in the second photo but did I automatically love what I saw in the mirror? Nope. The second photo was taken on a family holiday in Crete a few years ago where I spent meal times worried about what food I would be eating and how it would negatively impact me. How I felt about my weight took away any enjoyment I had on the holiday. However because in my eyes I wasn’t particularly ‘skinny’, I felt no one would take how I felt seriously and maybe it was just a normal way to feel. After all, everyone has eating issues these days right?! Only my immediate family know what I was going through. Thankfully, I had the realisation that this mindset wasn’t normal before it developed into something more extreme. Today my weight is fairly stable but now my focus is doing what makes ME feel good, not what some Instagram ‘expert’ is telling me to. What I hope to emphasise with this post - obviously it’s impossible to go cover all of it - is that mindset is EVERYTHING. If I didn’t know better, as a young, impressionable girl viewing this photo,  I would look at the before and after photos and think that I’d be immediately happier once I looked like the after. Body image and self-love will be something I continue to work on but I’m not ashamed to say how proud I am of myself. So never feel like you’re alone ❤️",1528129209,17944842019070052,"I experienced a similar family holiday in Turkey - instead of having fun I would spend an unreasonable amount of time in the hotel gym every afternoon, trying to burn off whatever calories I thought my breakfast + lunch amounted to. At this point I was already quite skinny due to months of careful eating and exercising after a girl at school had made fun of my curvy hips. But still I didn’t like what I saw in the mirror any better! Weight loss absolutely does not bring about a proportional increase in self esteem - and for me it actually took putting some weight back on and getting into cooking to start loving myself more and gain the healthy relationship with food that I deserve. You are a queen for sharing this and it will most definitely make a positive impact on those still struggling with those issues ❤️",andreearaslescu,1528134035,17922425932157846,@andie0402 Thank you for sharing your story so honestly too!

This weekend I have been getting around to putting away all of our Christmas gifts and as you can see, my gifts this year certainly had a theme to them. Looks like no one wants me to forget my true home when we finally make our big move in 2018. It was hard to open and see all these gifts and remember that I’m going to be so far from the people I love, but now I will get to have reminders in my new home of wonderful people and wonderful memories. And really, who are we kidding, there’s no way I can stay away from KC for long 😉

Has anyone else moved far away from home and family?? How did you manage? I know I’m going to have such a hard time so any thoughts and tips are appreciated!

ayeina_official-1829844263135994217.info,"I can't start the Gratitude Contest tomorrow till I'm not grateful to the backbone of AYEINA. .
.
Messenger of Allah (saws) said : ""Whoever is not grateful to the people, he is not grateful to Allah."" [Tirmidhi]
.
.
My husband didn't know anything about web development. He has studied Business. But he would spend hours and hours of his time learning it all simply to make one change in AYEINA. He handles so many things in the background that if I had to do it all on my own, I would have probably given up long ago. And if we'd ever start paying him for all the work he does, AYEINA would be broke in no time. . .
Ayesha's husband didn't have any experience in printing, shipping and warehousing etc. He has studied engineering. Yet he would go back and forth with the printers and stand for long hours at the courier services, packaging etc. .
.
They say that behind every successful man is a woman. What they forget is that sometimes behind every successful woman is a man. 
Sometimes behind every successful woman is another woman. 
Sometimes behind every successful woman is a bunch of unsung heroes. Who get nothing in return. Who only expect their reward from Allah. .
. 
P.S. Go thank someone in your life ❤ and then jot down the point for the caption contest 😁

Also this image represents HOORAAYY! Because we start the #GratitudeCaptionContest and #GratitudeArtContest tomorrow in shaa Allah. Get yourself and the kids ready (link in bio) 💞

Day #4 of my photo challenge is something homemade! And today, I’ve got a fun one for this (at least to me)!! 😂😂😂
.
Our whole family has been going through some heath issues and very low immunities. I’ve had TWO doctors and our nutritionist tell me now that I really need to be doing more fermented/cultured foods in our diet right now (yeah, yeah I get it already)!!
.
So slowly I’m starting to work a few simple things into our diet on a regular basis! It’s been years since I’ve made butter but I decided that cultured butter (real live probiotics in it) was a SUPER easy thing to add in (and seriously delicious)!!
.
So I’m making a few big containers of it that we can freeze for easy, daily access!
.
And I gotta tell you - butter is so easy to make! It takes less than 5 active minutes to make homemade cultured butter 😍😍😍😍

mamalinauk-1872413184149847983.info,"A few months back I asked my followers to summarise how periods made them feel. It was amazing to read the variety of responses - emotions were split between periods making us feel “connected to life’s flow”, “powerful, sensitive and “blessed” to “like being carved out with a rusty spoon”, “chaotic”, “cross” and “messy.” There was no holding back, and it was super powerful stuff
🔥
One thing’s for sure: our menstrual cycles evoke strong feelings in us and are a huge part of being a woman. They deserve attention and respect, which is why they’re such a freakin’ perfect starting place when it comes to making positive, plastic-free, money saving changes in our every day lives
🍃
Making one simple switch and ditching disposable sanitary products is world – changing stuff, and not just on an environmental level; on a personal level too saving money, avoiding nasties and never ever having to dash to the corner shop when you come on to purchase an overpriced piece of plastic - period pads contain 90 % plastic 😱 If there are alternatives, let’s try to start using them and stop unnecessarily purchasing billions (2.5 B in the U.K. alone to be exact) of plastic period products.

We are now the proud owners of an English Heritage pass which we used for the visit and I can’t wait to flex it at the weekends when they are back at school. Because after a week in a classroom we all need some adventure don’t we? We used our @Tescofood Clubcard vouchers to buy the pass. Such an ace system for collecting points super easily as you shop, to swap for days out, trips and meals for the family. It’s now even easier to collect points using the Clubcard app and contactless card - a tap is all if takes. More pictures and info over on the blog tonight (link in profile).

The little I have been reading has been Edith Wharton’s “The Custom of the Country” which failed to keep my interest at first. Now that I’m on the halfway mark I am rather liking it though. I have loved everything I have read from Wharton before - some novels and short stories. I think she has an exceptional skill to create strong female characters who can get on your nerves (I am afraid to say “unlikeable” cos I know many people will not agree with that term) but whom you can’t help but respect. Undine Spragg is no exception. She is carving her way in the social corridors, having only one sight and this is of course wealth. I am curious where this road will take her and wills he come out of it all unharmed. •

thegreenmum-2010352501791688434.info,"Do you guys have a fool-proof routine when it comes to buying in bulk? Without a doubt, bulk shopping is what allows me to avoid the most waste when it comes to food packaging.

Some of the pain points I have heard with regards to bulk buying have been things such as:
- location of the store
- lugging around heavy jars
- the level of organization required to take advantage of bulk
- how long the goods actually last before expiration

Let me show you how the steps I have taken to effectively shop in bulk (some include changes in mindset) and hopefully it will seems a little easier!

So the first thing I did was to source out some places that would allow me to fill my own containers that were either near my home or my workplace. 
Since I meal plan, I have a list of items I need on a weekly basis. So I quickly look through my pantry and take note of what I need (in my phone). Also, the minute I am low or out of something, I write it down on the dry erase board we keep on our fridge.

When it is time for a bulk run, I count out the number of jars I need for exactly what I plan to buy, and I add an extra jar for a treat! Whoop!

If I have a ton of stuff to buy, then I will use plastic Tupperware or reusable produce bags where I can. It makes the lifting component much easier! Or I try and look at it as an opportunity to exercise! 
I buy what I need for the week and ensure they are store in airtight containers.

And when I’m home, I literally shove everything in my pantry and I am done!

I’d like to note at this point that this only works because I am able bodied and so blessed. ❤️ So whaddya think? Is this doable? What other challenges do you see arising?

As awful as the last three days have been it has been nice to take a break from social media and to take some (forced) downtime - something I’ll admit I’m not very good at without good reason (aka some sort of illness or broken bone🤦🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️).

peterlappin-1902310571739587864.info,"A great tip from my haute couture construction professor @kennethdking at @fashioninstituteoftechnology. He taught us this brilliant method of creating hanger loops on our skirts. (I’m pretty sure he credited Susan Khalje with this idea.) The loops, which are attached to the waistband lining and interfacing, lie flat against the body when the skirt is worn so you don’t have to worry about the loops poking out of the skirt (see pic 1). Then when the skirt is hung and the waistband folds, loose loops are formed (pic 2). They should be approximately 6” long. We made ours from tubing made with bias strips cut from our lining—I used a loop turner to make mine.

clairerunsthere-1887798515235533050.info,"""Your greatest runs are rarely measured by racing success ... they are moments in time when running allows you to see how wonderful your life is!"" ✨
.
.
And the good news ... there are lots of great moments to look forward to! I haven't shaken this  post marathon high ... it's been 3 wks! 🙏
.
.
I've chatted w a few that are struggling w training right now, my advice: figure out what you can do to help elevate your running enjoyment. I had THE BEST TIME training, even though it was REALLY HARD! .
.
✨Get outside: scenic routes really help.
✨Find a running buddy (my summer friends found me; they stopped me & asked if I'd like to join them. We've been running 2 yrs together, race together too! ).
✨Crank up some kickass tunes (music can transport me when running, & when I hear a song played from my race (the good parts) I light up and smile (happy cry too)
✨change up time of day
✨Track your HR ... even if you don't feel like you're improving, your HR doesn't  lie. Same pace from 8 wks ago might track w a lower HR = you've gained fitness! 💪
✨Just like exercise class ... ""do one more"" get through one more interval, one more mile or one more minute b4 bagging it early. Second winds do happen. Regroup and redo tmrw if need be. ✨Sleep!!! If you haven't slept great & deeply, you might not perform well; flip flop days if you're scheduled to push hard but feel drained. .
.
Bottom line ... I loved training bc I tailored it to how I was feeling mentally & physically. I stuck to the wo & mileage but shifted the days around each wk. Plans are great but we're not machines ... & ultimately as you improve, you get excited to get back out there. Hope you have a fun time running  today! It's my primary focus ... to ENJOY  my moving meditation! 💃🏼
.
.
8 tempo miles at race pace felt AMAZING! ✨
.
PS ... I promise I won't write this much tomorrow 🙄

eviebookish-1761770197461428482.info,"I’m still struggling to find just the right skin care routine. The problem is, I like to try all of the shiny, new products, and I switch between them quite often, so it’s hard for me to figure out which one of them works and which one I should drop. Is that normal? (Probably not 😒). .
I’ve been trying my best to find products that are not irritating to my skin, but really moisturizing. I don’t like greasy stuff, or products that make your face sticky..
.
So far I have a small handful of products that I know that I love. One of them is Skin Watchers Ceramizing Cream. Then I also love the Pixi Beauty Glow Mist (I am addicted to how this makes me feel and how it smells 😋). But when it comes to overnight masks, serums and eye creams, I haven’t found my holy grail yet. So I’m wondering - what works for you? Is there a skin care products you stick with or always go back to? Please, share your recs!
.
So far, I’m liking the Mermaid Skin serum, but can’t really tell yet if it’s making any difference for my skin. It does feel nice on my face and neck and it’s not sticky like some other serums I’ve tried, but the jury is still out on this one for now!

I've never had a real baby, but I'd imagine that the vulnerability, fear, awe, humility, and deep pride are not dissimilar. This year of birthing #TheWellnessProjectBook baby has brought me all the feels. It found a home on so many of your shelves, and subsequently changed your lives in so many more ways than I could have ever imagined. I couldn't be more grateful for you and the whole adventure. 🙏🏼
It feels crazy to ask for anything after all the support you've given me. But if you feel so inclined to share a photo, a tip, a thought, or an endorsement today to celebrate another year of #thewellnessproject, I would be so touched. After a year of these notes, I KNOW that this book will make you laugh while it helps you heal. It would mean the world if you could help me continue to spread the word.🗣 To leave an Amazon review (you don't have to have bought the book there to do so) you can click the link in my profile. As a thank you, I'm going to give away a signed copy of the book and ✨THE LAST✨ wellness project tote bag I have in my possession to someone today. Just tag me in your post or screenshot your amazon review and DM it to me. I'll announce the winner on stories tomorrow! 😎
And in case you missed the announcement a few weeks ago, the book now has a Spanish-speaking sister!! I am celebrating by flying to Mexico tomorrow where I plan to search for it in the wild.

micaelahoo-1855947249327327475.info,"I was going to caption this picture: “People who have good style can look good in a white t-shirt and jeans. I’m trying my best.” But let’s talk about something different: being comfortable in your own skin. As a child, I never was an active person. I liked the idea of the outdoors, but what I liked even better was being inside working on an art project or reading a book. I’d exercise on and off, but nothing regular. I was never overweight, but in middle school and the beginning of high school, I was soft and weak. I started getting into exercise when I was in high school and a friend invited me to run a half marathon. I enjoyed the process of training and working towards a goal. In a span of 4 years, I ran 8 half marathons. I placed first in my age group in the San Francisco half marathon. It was a real high. When my body started telling me to find something less impactful on my joints, I transitioned to swimming. I never swam for speed, but I enjoyed the light feeling of gliding through the smooth water. I also supplemented with abs, weights, body weight exercises, and walking. All through this time, my body got toned and strong and I loved it.
.
Having leaky gut and going through whatever else is causing my gut inflammation has robbed me of my most sacred comforts: time, sleep, energy, agility, and strength. My back, shoulders, and neck go out of alignment on a regular basis and I haven’t been able to stick to a consistent workout routine since April. I tried swimming this morning and couldn’t make it 5 minutes without my neck hurting. I look at myself and see my abs aren’t as toned as they used to be. The backs of my arms have more give when I lift them up to tie my hair back. I fear I that I’ll never be able to be fit again, but I know that is my ego talking. My intuition knows I need to heal and if healing means majorly cutting back my exercise, then so be it. I’ve heard the phrase, “Your work is not your worth” and this is something I need to remember. Until then, I’ll be doing slower exercises I used to scoff at, like walking and stretching and the everyday exercise of life. This is just a season in my life. When I’m ready, I’ll get back into it.",1535466174,17959112188117820,@micaelahoo I’m having the same issues right now. I gained 17lbs. And I’m having a hard time working out because of my pain.

amanda_bo_-1722702039613874492.info,"I remember specific moments that changed my life and sparked my fitness journey. I was 19, working at Abercrombie. I was a size 10 and they were getting tight. One day I had to try on a size 12... The largest size they sold.
✨
That feeling I had staring back at myself in the changing room mirror was terrible. I decided right then and there that instead of buying larger pants I was going to take matters into my own hands and lose the weight.
✨
I was working out and lifting at that time. But I was eating like crap! Fast food, junk food, sugary drinks. I cut it all out and lost 45lbs in less than 8 months.
✨
But guess what? People talked MORE shit when I got healthy than when I was overweight. ""You're too skinny, you need to eat a cheese burger, are you doing cocaine?!""
✨
That's because they don't want you to change, they don't want you to go for your greatness. If you change that means little have to learn how to treat you differently, that means they have to change, and humans with limiting beliefs resist change at all costs.

Do it anyway!

I’m looking forward to trying new recipes in 2019 and making Show-Me Whole Living a place where you come for real talk about natural living, easy recipes for busy lives, and a little bit of laughter.
.
Thanks for being here and joining me on this journey.

Airports:: ✈️TSA allows pretty much anything if it’s for your kiddo (even liquids) so go go squeezes we’re fine. We brought milk through in Atlanta but I don’t recommend doing that in a busy airport if you can avoid it (just takes longer to get it approved) ✈️if you don’t get assigned to a seat next to the person you’re traveling with, ASK to be moved! ✈️if your little one freaks out - just let them. It’ll be over faster! And you’ll never see these people on the plane again 😉

Hotels:: 💙keep up bedtime routine as much as possible :: we did our bedtime songs and brushing teeth 💙each day got better 💙bring noise machine (or duplicate sleeping as much as possible!) •

😘baby melatonin is a life saver!! We used zarabees 😍
😘using an easy and prolonged snack (m&ms) is ideal •

goodiegoodieglutenfree-1834180445124688341.info,"GF TRAVEL HACK 🍒 • // As a Celiac, I used to find it SO super hard to travel! What was I going to eat?!!!! And how was I going to survive the trip worrying what I could eat, worrying what is safe or not safe and having a shit ton of extra anxiety about something most people don’t even think about on a daily basis. So it was always, can you guess? Super stressful for me to travel. A hundred (I’m exaggerating) extra fears and worries strapped to my back before I even pack for the airport. Give me an Amen if you know what I’m talking about. It was a really bad way for me to live with all that extra worry - as I’m sure it is for you. And if you’re like me you probably pack a LOT of food in your suitcase.  And maybe even travel less. I so get it - Chronic Illness warrior over here. 
#
But now I think VERY differently. When in Rome or doubt, eat fresh fruit and whole veggies (sans sauces). And no, you’re not a Vegan but you can be more plant-based when you travel making life so much easier and worry free. Meaning, you’ll always have fruit and veggies.  It’s an option we don’t consider because we want snacks, but fruit and veggies can be snacks too and they are actually functional. We make this too hard on ourselves. Ever since I dropped the idea of Fruit Fear aka @medicalmedium and one time saw @fullyrawkristina eating dates on the plane as her plane snack I realized something. We don’t need to live in a panic over what is safe. When in doubt, eat the food Mother Nature gave us. We are as a country plant deprived anyways and as a Celiac community I’ve noticed it’s a very processed world.  Eat more plants. I definitely want to hear your thoughts below!✌🏻👇🏼

gofastmommy-1908263122305873165.info,"Thankful I get to run with these views everyday. Also thankful for my trusty @aftershokz headphones. Let me tell you a story about running my first (and only other) full marathon. It was stormy and windy as all get out. I was using the headphones that came with my phone for the race. The ear buds always fell out on regular runs but on a day when the gusts were so hard that they literally knocked my hat off (several times!) forget about it! I got so frustrated with having to constantly push and poke them back into my ears that I eventually just gave up on music altogether! And don’t even get me started on how tangled up my cord got. Bottom line, when you’re running, things can get frustrating enough, you don’t want your headphones to become a bother too. .
.
I’ve been running with @aftershokz for about a year and a half now and I absolutely LOVE them. Not only are they super comfy and lightweight, they never fall off, never skip, never fail me. My favorite feature though is that they allow me to hear my surroundings because they use bone conduction technology and rest outside of my ears. Can’t ask for more than safety and function and these blow both out of the park..

My own mental and physical health took a dive, and I felt I had lost my passion for running the business I have loved for so many years. Depression has a way of throwing a wet wool sweater over anything that brings you joy, and it was obfuscating all the things I love about what I do.

Keeping my presence going on social media made things worse: As I would scroll through people's cheery, polished posts, I felt even more sad about my own tear-stained life. Any post I made felt fraudulent— as much as I strive to be my ""authentic self"" online, there was much I wasn't saying about what was going on, and it made me think of how narrow that presentation of ""the real me"" often is. I have done a ton of re-thinking my social media presence and how I can bring you more value, and more of myself, tough times and all. 
While I was posting less, I was listening more. More than ever before, people are frustrated with, afraid of and angered by technology: Whether it be devices designed to hijack our attention, social media giants who mine our data for their gain, household devices that capture our conversations, or the feeling that we're losing our children to what's behind their screens.

These days, it feels like technology and I have divergent values, and that's an awful feeling when you earn your living sharing products and apps with people. I used to write about any tech that I thought saved people ""time, money and sanity,"" but I now feel I need to focus more on helping people navigate the muddy waters of an unchecked industry that has played too fast and loose with our safety and well-being.

Then somehow during my adult years, I lost this habit of exploring worlds outside my own. The only kind of reading I did was from a textbook, required readings from class, and online articles that pop up on my Facebook newsfeed. Whatever happened during my adult years, I don't know. Did I become too busy to sit down and enjoy a good read or two? Or did I lose the curiosity I had as a kid? Either way, I want to rediscover the magic of books, and feel like a kid again. After all, we are always learning and growing, and our age should not stop us from being a kid at heart. I'm ready to pick up a book, and open up a new world of discovery 📚✨

fitbyfifty.us-1949426843476428830.info,"SELF SABOTAGE - The behavior that creates problems in our life that interferes with long standing goals . .
Did you know that procrastination is one of the leading behaviors of self sabotage?  Procrastination is  fueled by excuses ... “I’m too tired , I’m too busy,  I can’t afford a gym membership, I’m a Mom, I work full time, etc etc.  Self sabotage is also a product of fear of both failure AND success . We may be afraid that we can’t do something or won’t be good at it , but also fear actually being successful because with that success also comes change ... like “I won’t be able to eat Taco Bell” every day “ 😉. .
This was me three years ago.  I hated the way I looked but found every excuse in the book to get in my own way of doing something about it . My personal “fear of success” was knowing that it actually took “work” .  It’s not like exercise and lifting weights is a peace of cake. Sometimes it hurts , it can be a bit unpleasant ... we sweat , we breath heavy , feel pain , and we push ourselves to exhaustion. (Ouch) Sitting on a couch or in front of a computer is much easier , #amiright ? and I knew that if I started to get back in shape I had to keep it up and continue the hard work . The success meant discomfort to me,so I feared it.
.
I had to start taking each one of my excuses and analyzing them in order to understand that it really was my mind that was getting in my way.  As an example, when  analyzing the time restriction factor excuse , I started to pay close attention to everything I did in a day and I clearly remember an afternoon of doing laundry.  The dryer cycle was 38 minutes.  I had 38 minutes to wait until I needed to fold and hang those clothes .  Perfect time to get a workout  in because all I needed was 30 minutes for that at home.  What do you know ?! I have the time ! 🤷🏻‍♀️
.
That way of thinking lead to more revelations and me finally realizing I had no excuses . .
Don’t self sabotage the possibility of being comfortable in your own skin because you’re afraid of failure .... or success .  This is where the quotes “be stronger than your excuses “ and “mind over matter “ come into play. Don’t procrastinate ! 💪😘",1546609810,18020412745056411,😍 Love this!

There is prescription products like Epiduo that @glowbyamgy already mentioned. Epiduo combines Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide and since it is a registered combination drug it has been demonstrated to be superior to mono treatment in randomized clinical trials. However, the choice of retinoid seems to impact the level of irritation and apparently adapalene showed best results when compared to other retinoids. There also seems to be a question of dose and a combination of 0.1% adapalene and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide has been demonstrated to be less irritating than 5% benzoyl peroxide treatment alone (a common OTC strength). Although I do agree that this type of combination treatment might not be for everyone and mono therapy might be doctors choice for a specific patient. However this does not mean that retinoids (adapalene) and benzoyl peroxide counteract each others effectiveness, quite the opposite! All the best 🧘🏼‍♂️",skinreasons,1525299930,17901812545198311,"@glowbyamgy I agree it can be a hit or dismiss for a specific individual. But studies only tell us what it looks like at a group level. Which is why I think the statement that retinoids and benzoyl counteract each others effectiveness is misleading, since it is contrary to scientific evidence. But yes as you say, dryness and peeling from epiduo should be a common side effect of the drug. Personally I have only bad experience from benzoyl peroxide and would not apply it all over face.  I would like to try short contact therapy tho, applying only to spots.  Where did you read epiduo can lead to rosacea? If any severe reaction is caused by the drug it should subside with discontinued use? In my understanding Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder, episodic, and with unknown etiology. But yes a flare-up might be triggered by topical products. I agree with you that everyone has to listen to their skin and that balance is key! 🙌🏻","@glowbyamgy I agree it can be a hit or dismiss for a specific individual.

lenaridley-1853721765088521404.info,"🤱🏼🥛 Just pulled our last bag of breast milk from the deep freeze.  28oz. and we will be totally done with breastmilk.  Although Georgia hasn’t been getting it every day, we still use it pretty regularly.  I’m so happy that she was able to get it for 18 months!  Our breastfeeding journey was overall pretty easy but in the beginning a lot of tears were shed because it IS painful and you WILL want to quit, but I kept at it and we got really good at it.  Then as I prepared to return to work, I started pumping at 6 weeks once a day.  It wasn’t until I returned to work at 9 weeks PP that I would realize how much work pumping was.  Dragging my pump to work every day, having to take it to weddings, bachelorette parties, basically any time I was away from my baby for more than 2 hours, I had to stop everything and pump.  I was prone to clogged ducts and had them multiple times throughout my year of nursing.  I am proud of our journey.  There’s so much judgement around every choice we make as parents—breastfed vs. formula, vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated, cosleeping vs. sleep training, we are all just trying to do our best and not only raise kind human beings, but trying to keep them alive!  Breastfeeding was what I chose as a parent, and it worked well for us.  I hope that I have the opportunity with our future children to experience the breastfeeding bond again one day.  #breastfeeding #breastfeedingjourney #thisistheend .

Maybe not this extreme everyday, but to show you my life isn't always beautiful trips, hiking, and puppy dogs.  Those are just the things I NEED to do to cope with the moments like this one. .
.
People ask, ""how do you not take this home with you?"" The answer is... I don't know. Things that happened here you can't unsee, but I suppose I try to think more about the work family and the effort put into this situation.
.
.
Work Family: The people you see almost everyday, you don't always get along, but when the going gets tough, you come together. .
.
And that's exactly what happened.  Going home knowing everyone communicated thoroughly, asked for advice on what we could do next, no matter if you were nurse, surgeon, Anesthesiologist,  CRNA, scrub tech, attending, resident, new grad or experienced. No idea is stupid. Everyone is equal with one common goal... to literally save a life.  Whether you are successful or not, you can honestly say you tried everything.
.
.
I'm going to miss this work family when I leave.  The teamwork is hands down some of the best I've seen anywhere. But I'm ready to take a break from this scene and do small outpatient elective surgeries at my next travel nurse assignment. A change of pace to help heal my heart from seeing these tragedies... but I'll be back.

My assault happened when I was 20 and I was on a high dose of drugs from getting my wisdom teeth pulled. I asked my best friend (a guy) to come over and hang out with me so someone could take care of me while I was alone at home.

#Vulnerability Post 58- The Seeds We Sow⠀
⠀
Have you seen the Redwoods? I haven't, but they fascinate me. Along the pacific coastline there are redwood trees taller than 360 ft.⠀
⠀
360 feet!!!⠀
⠀
And those trees each started as a seed. ⠀
⠀
This week I've been a bit IG MIA; my heart is heavy.⠀
⠀
I like the imagery of a forest inside each of us & it's trees each started with a seed. Some of the seeds are good & some are bad. ⠀
⠀
I am realizing that my personal forest has many bad trees. Trees of self-doubt & hate. Trees that don't belong in my forest.⠀
⠀
How did this happen??? ⠀
⠀
Somewhere along the way, words & life experiences have planted a seed in my soft soil; A seed that says I am not worthy of love & kindness, that I am undeserving.⠀
⠀
That seed burrowed deep down in the rich earth of my heart & fed off each pain & rejection until a tree was born. And I?, I have tended dutifully to that tree with tears & fears. I have plucked bitter fruit from it's branches, taken bite after bite, gagged it down, & told myself I was full & it tasted great (which really now- I'm a food blogger: I should know better!).⠀
⠀
But this tree is not mine & I am tired. ⠀
⠀
I want a forest full of trees that know what it's like to have a soft heart, to be generous, & to be fierce. Trees that know what its like to feel light & joyful. Trees full of sunshine & laughter. I want giant redwood trees that know what it's like to have the sweet ambrosia nectar of love flowing in their sap. A forest with a pure heart.⠀
⠀
If you've been with me awhile, then you know I am actively trying to plant new seeds. BUT sometimes I get stuck in the shade of the ugly trees. I look at them too long & I start to believe they belong.⠀
⠀
I think it's important to ""behold"" the seeds when they get planted. But sometimes an innocent heart doesn't want to see the ugly seeds & a broken heart can't. So those trees begin to grow...⠀
⠀
When we realize what's growing, we need to cut them down; stroke by stroke. Not stopping until we've pulled the roots & planted flowers in their place!",1538709011,17879287225276516,I grew up among the redwoods. They are magnificent. 😉 This is beautifully written.

•
For me, it will always be functionality. As you guys know I move around a LOT in my workouts - so if I can't move in it (basically....if I can't do burpees in it) - I probably won't be buying it lol. So I have my signature ""move test,"" which some of you were lucky to see on last weeks insta stories 😂👊🏼
•
Can I squat jump? Can I burpee? Can I punch? And can I kick? If all 4 check the box, then we're in business!!
•
Now, there are some bonuses I always look for as well. They aren't deal breakers, but added points if they have a cute pattern. I love me some color blocks, mesh details, and a high waist.  If you were wondering.....this outfit checks all the boxes @90degreebyreflex

My first real introduction into Irish whiskey was Redbreast 15, and to this day it is still one of my favorites. As I kept chugging along on my whisk(e)y journey, I was then introduced to Yellow Spot, another fantastic drop, and Teeling, Knappogue Castle, Green Spot and Tullamore Dew, all which bring something special to the table. I love that Teeling Single Malt is an easy, smooth everyday sipper and Redbreast 12 Cask Strength is a powerful, yet balanced and warm drop. Yellow Spot has become my ""holiday"" dram, and pairs very well with Thanksgiving dinner, and is creamy and a fantastic pour any other day of the year too! I forgot to mention @hyde_irish_whiskey , having finished the bottle before I could review it, it was THAT good! Having just had some whiskey from @tipperaryboutiquedistillery and reading about how @whiskeygate is the only all female Irish whiskey company in the world, in this mornings news has me even more excited to keep digging into what lovely whiskies Ireland has to offer!

catebutler-1872002733184232737.info,"“Knowledge may be power, but cake has great bargaining properties.” ― Julia Seitz
•
Sometimes the middle of the week calls for fresh flowers and baking a cake. Earlier this week, I read a newsletter from @jessicarosewilliams. She talked about her recent travels to Sweden and the concept of “Fika”. I’m not sure what made this email stand out to me, maybe because of the busy-ness of life or something subconscious in me that simply took note. But, this Swedish tradition of setting aside a small pocket of time in the afternoon to enjoy a hot drink and a treat, really appealed to me. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate undertaking - it’s simply a chance to slow down. I’ve found as I get older (and hopefully wiser), one of my greatest pleasures is taking a quiet moment for myself - getting my mind space back into a manageable rhythm. The modern world clamours all around us, so those quiet moments can be sheer bliss. I know I find myself seeking opportunities to slow down and appreciate the good things in life, don’t you?
•
The slower months of autumn and winter are upon us, so I think this small, but pleasurable ritual, will be a perfect reminder to stop, and be a bit more mindful of time.

wovenblends-1836396465124057506.info,"Last night as I caught up on my devotional “finding God in hard places”, a few things stood out to me, like how we invite death into our lives due to all the negative lyrics and visuals we engage with. 
A lot of us underestimate the power of media in our lives, especially social media. Being saturated in these things shapes our mindsets on what we should be and look like. 
As the new month springs in, I find myself asking myself this question “by what standards do you judge yourself?” Personally, for the most part of this year, I’ve found myself judging myself through social media engagement and my ability to succeed in more personal things. Tbh, this is self consuming and draining. It hinders you from even being the best version of yourself for yourself.

So my question for you today is “by what standards do you judge yourself?” Now, let that sink in.",1533135539,17903223112220896,"Definitely not by social media, I judge myself from how far I have come and how close I am to where I want to be.

And we really thought that we would never do anything fun again. We thought we wouldn’t go on vacations or travel. So a few weeks later we went on a trip to visit some National Parks and stayed at our favorite Best Western in Cortez CO (they have the most amazing toiletries!!!) where we have stayed a million times on trips to El Paso. And that’s where we saw a beautiful family with a child in a wheelchair and that showed me that a disability doesn’t have to  stop you from getting out as a family. I was so wrong in my perceptions about Down syndrome. I never imagined back then that I would be here with all my children on another amazing vacation. The Best Western in Ashland OR is straight out of an English garden and Ruby had so much fun running around seeing the amazing flowers. Another amazing National Park in the books!!!

savjimenez-1881460024125906554.info,"I got a lot of questions on my post about living a life based on food fears, and how I got past that. While it was a long process and there is no simple fix, I wanted to share a few things that really helped me get out of that mindset.
•
1️⃣) No black & white mentality- I used to think that if I had a piece of chocolate at night that my whole day of clean eating would be ruined. I would never indulge because I thought it was either 100% clean or nothing, which is such an unhealthy way to think! Now I allow myself to have chocolate, or whatever I'm craving, because I know I eat healthy most of the time. This prevents bingeing as well!
•

2️⃣) Don't discriminate certain food/foods- I would get the biggest cravings for things that I all of the sudden told myself I couldn't have. Bread, donuts, bread, wine, even BANANAS (because I thought it was too sugary, omg...) I wouldn't have a craving for these things normally, but since they were completely off limits they became extremely desirable. Instead of saying ""I can't ever have bread"" tell yourself you can have it a couple times a week and that's still part of a healthy diet.
•

3️⃣) Don't seclude yourself- I would constantly skip events, meet-ups with my friends and even some family functions because I was afraid of being around normal food. I was afraid of messing up my diet because I was so worried about eating clean all of the time. Those times won't make a difference in your body and also going out to a restaurant/event is going to be part of your life. You can learn how to eat healthy out and also indulge when you want! It's better than missing your family, friends and experiences of life!

This is a BTS look at Dexter doing a photo shoot in their “dog bedroom”. (Dex is staring at one of the Bostons) They have their own bed, dresser and closet full of clothes and props. In addition to our collection of totes in the basement full of even more “stuff”. 🙄🙈😂
.
Half of our photos are taken in this room because of the incredible natural light. One day, when I learn Photoshop, I want to photograph dogs and babies for others, but I don’t feel ready just yet.
.
The backdrop is 1/8” thick piece of cheap wood that I spray painted to make in to a chalkboard. I used chalk to write on it , then erased everything leaving behind this wonderful, soft pattern that photographs so well. This works so much better than a sheet which shows too many wrinkles. This summer I am going to paint the other side too. I just haven’t decided what color.

smallstuffemily-1819256127399137482.info,"Hello! I’m Emily. There are always new people around here so I thought I’d take a sec to introduce myself. .
My goal is to help you create a beautiful, organized, thriving home. Your house will always be a work in progress, but I hope the projects and resources I share here and on my blog will help you achieve the vision you have for your home. I wholeheartedly believe that DIY projects don’t have to be huge – even the small stuff counts!
.
I’m not a DIY pro by any means, but I will most definitely research and read every blog post under the sun about a project I want do in my home. I love sharing what I learn as I go! I blog about home decor, crafts and organizing (my favorite!). Our home improvement budget and tool collection are both minuscule, but I am working to make our house a home one small project at a time. .
We moved to a house in the suburbs of Des Moines, Iowa last fall and I’m now on a mission to slowly make over every bit of this beige, builder grade home. .
I wish I could invite you over for lemonade and a chat but since that’s not possible would you tell me something about you in the comments? Where do you live? What are your hobbies? I’d love to learn a little about you because I want Instagram to be a place where I can connect with real people, not build up a large number of “followers” I can’t tell you a thing about. .

alessandrascutnik-1835155274638442435.info,"WHY I STOPPED TRACKING CALORIES BURNED ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When training for my bikini competition, I would wear a Polar HR monitor and track my daily caloric burn. I would do extra workouts to hit a certain number, and I would find myself surrounding my day to hit that number. It turned out to be an ugly obsession. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I ended up ditching my HR monitor all together after my competition in 2014. I realized that it was doing more harm than good, but I also realized that number did not matter to me. When I started flexible dieting and ultimately started learning more about nutrition as a whole, tracking how many calories I burned daily became a thing of the past. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you’re an average gym-goer, tracking your macros/calories, and just eating and training to better your overall lifestyle, there’s really no reason for you to be obsessing about how many calories your FitBit says you burned today. Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) should be used to calculate your macros anyway- so it’s already factored in. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As I’m entering this fat loss phase, there’s things I’m focusing on and things I’m not focusing on. Here’s what’s important to me:
-Consistent nutrition + adhering to my macros
-Adequate sleep + recovery
-Hydration (around 100 ounces of water daily)
-Consistent strength sessions + sticking to 1 high-intensity cardio session each week
-Consistent fiber intake (around 35-45g sits best with me)
-Managing stress via my daily walks + down time with Josh and my family
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Have you ever tracked calories burned? I know I can’t be the only one!

Dieting doesn’t have to suck. If done right, you shouldn’t feel like shit day in and day out. You shouldn’t be obsessing over how many calories you burned, and you shouldn’t be sacrificing other health goals to achieve a certain level of body fat. Train smart. Eat smart. Live happy <3 #evolveyourperspective

sanne_reads-2015392072074088729.info,"I’m currently reading The River by Peter Heller - thanks @aaknopf for gifting me a copy.🙌 The River tells the story of college friends Jack and Wynn who face a series of threats while on what should have been a leisurely canoe trip. As with Heller’s The Dog Stars it took me some time to get used to the writing style, but now I have and I don’t want to put the book down! I’m totally immersed in this atmospheric survival thriller set on the Maskwa River in Northern Canada and I’m learning lots about canoeing, wildlife, forest fires and surviving in the outdoors (at times a bit too detailed for my liking, I'm not into fishing that much😂). I was looking up some things online - like river hydraulics - and ended up watching kayaking videos. Let me just say that I’m in complete and utter awe of the extreme sports kind featuring huge waterfalls and rapid rivers (what a thrill that must be).🌊 Is this a book that you’d pick up? And are you as inexperienced with surviving in the wild as I am?😀🌲

lex.weinstein-1973514671646603619.info,"My course in sustainable enterprise has begun and never did I imagine what I’m uncovering. A shift in me has occurred. What an exciting time to be alive! We are now at a point where we can track the data of businesses with purpose over a 20 year span. The arguments are solid, the facts are in. Businesses who don’t just greenwash, but have a greater social or environmental cause at the forefront of their mission statements are, in many cases, doubling the profits of their non-socially responsible competitors. ⠀⠀
.
And why is that?? (My fav part...) BECAUSE OF US! Because of the diligent spread of activism over the last 50 years, the pressure put on businesses by consumers towards sustainability, and through the use of the internet/social media to demand transparency in all areas of business practices. We are at the dawn of a new age, an age where it is accepted that profit and purpose are NOT at odds, but work hand in hand in creating a world in which we can truly thrive. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
Not to sound naive, but for the first time in a long time I have hope. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I see a way in which corporate innovation and the mission of a collective consciousness can repair our planet and heal past wrongdoings. But our time is limited and we cannot accomplish anything without hard work. We must actively do our parts to create strong, supportive communities and a future of business with women at the forefront (love you guys but we’re coming in hot 🔥). No longer will success be defined solely by the individual. It is through our lifting of each other up towards achieving greatness that we will truly thrive. The hive mentality is what will guide us into a more peaceful, abundant future, with purpose and an end goal of multiplied success. It is more important than ever to find your tribe, your group of likeminded, forward thinking friends and support each other in the re envisioning of a future where our planet is truly recognized as the source of our sustenance, one to be cherished and protected. .⠀⠀

#ad Finances have been pretty stretched with me giving up work to focus on my blog, shop, house, and children, so luxuries are few and far between while my business grows.

Phil and I are trying to make savings where we can, without having too much of a negative impact on our lives, and using the @ukwonderbill app has been really helpful where that’s concerned.

By seeing all of our monthly outgoings in one place without having to scroll through every single transaction on my banking app, I’ve been able to easily see where savings could be made. Do we really use that children’s film subscription or would that money be better off in our account, with a sneaky couple of quid being used to treat my gorgeous boy to a Toby mocha?

The app is pretty straightforward to use, once you’ve invested a bit of time adding  your regular payments and direct debits to it. It easily pulls through the data each month and gives tips as to where you can make savings, such as switching energy providers.

I really think that contactless payments and everything being online, make it too easy to lose track of your finances, so personally I think that if more people spent a few minutes setting something like WonderBill up, and actually paying attention to where their money goes, they’ll realise that there are pretty much *always* savings that can be made.

Find out more at http://bit.ly/billbrave

Now, I’m off to continue enjoying a coffee with my favourite boy, at our favourite cafe 💕

Obsessing over your insecurities.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We all have them. Wanna know mine?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
-My acne (or should I say pregnancy BACNE bc that ish is real)
-My teeth that still aren’t straight after TWO ROUNDS OF BRACES
-How my eyebrows just fade away halfway through
-My birthmark on the back of my neck
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’m not sharing this so you comment and try to cheer me up, I’m sharing this because I want you to know it’s normal to have them, but you CAN overcome them.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We ALL have things we may not love about our bodies, but ya know what?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Constantly obsessing and focusing in on those things is not going to make them go away, nor will it make you feel any better.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It’s proven that focusing on only the negative things about your body (or anything in your life honestly), will only continue to bring you further negativity.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
‼️How can you expect yourself to love and appreciate your body when you’re constantly trying to bring it down?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Imagine this: that inner dialogue in your head is your BFF. Imagine your internal thoughts as an actual human who spoke to you every day. Would you want to be friends with them after just one day of that crap…HECK NO!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So I challenge you right NOW to focus on what you DO love about your body. It may sound silly, but switching that dialogue in your head is the first step to loving and appreciating the body you have.

ariana.cleo-1952474385598055312.info,"5 Lessons I’ve Learned from NOT working out for 4 months
•
When this photo was taken I was working out twice a day, running frantically from place to place to find peace of mind and meditation through movement. I had played sports competitively since I was 4 years old and was under the impression that if I stopped moving my body would stop producing endorphins and I would become severely depressed. I was going through many changes in my life and was storing all of my stress in my body, Specifically my pelvis. My pelvis was causing my right hip to be an inch higher than my left, causing my entire body to be off balance, giving me such bad sciatica I could barely walk. I saw a chiropractor, a spine rehabilitation doctor, an acupuncturist, a psychical therapist, nothing would release my spine back into place, and was forced to stop moving, to slow down. Currently I am still working on resolving the 25 years of emotional and physical trauma I have stored in my body, but here is what I have learned in the process.
•
1. If working out provides your body more stress than stress relief… stop. 
You have on average 78.69 years to live as a female in the US and wellness is a continuum that can not be achieved in a 60 minute hiit class everyday in your 20's. •
2. What you do to your body NOW will effect you FOR LIFE.
 All those years of playing sports for 6 hours a day and abusing my body for ""fun"" will be something I will continue to reverse the damage forever. We are meant to live as hunter and gatherers, which means times of hard physical activity and times of complete rest. Performing high intensive physical activity everyday is not sustainable for the human body. •
3. Life is not a competition. 
This is a hard pill for me to swallow. I was raised believing that everything I do is a competition and there can only be one winner. That is false. There can be many winners and if there is only one winner everyone else must lose and I don't want to advocate for losing.

theleanlawyer-1651739188164180190.info,"Happpppy Sunday!
I've had a lovely relaxed weekend that started with a @psyclelondon class and ended with a walk in Epping Forest 👌🏻 We got back quite early this evening so I've spent the rest of the day making lunches from my new @deliciouslyella book 😍
I've found this vegan challenge bloody hard but her recipes have been sooo helpful so thanks to everyone who recommended it! I actually used loads of her recipes when I started eating more healthily but haven't made anything of hers in a while. So after about a week of giving the vegan way of life a go, these are my thoughts:
THE BAD BITS
1. My weak spot will always be cheese and it made me crack twice this week. 
2. Eating out is hard and I've taken it for granted how easy it is to get veggie food at restaurants. Veggie food in restaurants is always cooked in butter and topped with cheese it seems which makes it hard to stick to vegan food when eating out.
3. The only vaguely acceptable milk replacement in coffees is pat milk. I'm sorry guys but soy is gross and coconut is even worse 😂 
4. If you have/have had an eating disorder or have issues with your relationship with food please be really careful with going vegan. I have found myself constantly analysing what I eat and stressing about whether things have certain ingredients. It is very restrictive so I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.
THE GOOD BITS:
1. The food is bloody amazing sometimes! I've been eating way more veg and as a huge bean fan, I find the meals dreamy 😍  I've been way more creative than usual and I've rediscovered my love of cooking 🎉
2. I feel good about what I'm doing for the environment and the animals. It's made me confront the issues with the food industry that I usually try to ignore.
3. I've realised that we rely on animal products way too much. I was eating a bag of popcorn and saw that it had milk powder in. That seems unnecessary so I'm glad my eyes have been opened.
I'll be doing a full blog post on this next week after my two weeks are up so these are just my takeaways for now! Let me know how you've found it if you've tried it! ❤️",1511122676,17879526226175579,Sounds like such a good thing to try!!

the.life.of.laura-1886897818708561090.info,"It’s time for some #RealTalk. I wasn’t going to upload these photos. My outfit wasn’t flattering. My hair was a mess. And what the hell am I doing with my hand?! and honestly, I just hate photos of me. I’ve been really struggling with my body image recently and have become very critical of how I look. I’ve been struggling with some weight problems and have been feeling fat and frumpy all the time. I have struggled with my skin and wishing that it was clear and “perfect” just like the women we see plastered across social media. I haven’t had a day in the last couple of months where I’ve looked in the mirror and felt confident and happy with what I’ve seen. Yes, I’ve made changes to help me feel fitter and healthier (more exercise, eating better) but because results aren’t instant, it didn’t help how critical I was at the girl staring back at me. 
As Dave would say “What is perfect?! Why is acne considered bad? And Laura, you look amazing”. And he poses two great questions. Why is it that we consider clear skin to be the optimal skin, when let’s be honest - we all battle blemishes. Why to we consider stick skinny girls to be what we should all look like? 
I now understand that there are other issues that are contributing to my appearance and I’m coming to terms with that. While it’s not going to be an instant change, I am trying to (slowly) change my mindset to a positive one. So I decided to upload the photos and show myself some #SelfLove from a fun and happy day with the girls. 
And that’s the real talk done for today. What I want to finish with is a thank you. To all of you for your amazing support and making me feel like I can conquer the world. You guys are the real MVP’s and honestly, I don’t know what I could do without you.

malloryrowan-1656824476165235671.info,"Let’s talk about wearing shorts in the gym.☝🏼
.
When I first started working out in a gym, I wore shorts ALL 👏🏼 THE 👏🏼 TIME 👏🏼. I came from the world of dance and pole fitness, so it was a regular outfit for me. As I got more into lifting, I found myself buying more leggings than shorts.
.
People were staring at me at the gym. Was it because I was lifting heavy? Was it because I wore my thick legs with confidence, cellulite and all? I didn’t look like the other girls, I didn’t lift like the other girls.
.
In the past year, shorts have started to make a comeback in my workouts but every time I put them on, I have the same internal debate: what exercises am I doing today? Will my cellulite look gross? Will people notice or is it all in my head?
.
I’m a confident woman, but we all have our weaknesses. We all have insecurities that we can’t shut out despite how much we try.
.
Stop worrying and put on the damn shorts. The gym is hot AF and you should just wear the damn shorts. ❤️",1511728890,17850259672222674,"For heavy squat day it has to be tights, usually full length ones or I cannot get my knee sleeves haha on arm day (as I like to call it lol) I’d wear shorts sometimes but still feel self conscious as hell.

💊Rightly or wrongly I feel nutrition has been overlooked in the field of dermatology for a long time but in recent years we are starting to understand the important role it plays in skin health.
💊One area which really interests me is gut health. A study by Fabbrocini et al (2016) showed that when probiotic supplements were given to a group of adults with acne, after 12 weeks they saw a significant improvement in their acne compared to the group taking placebos. If you are suffering with a skin complaint I’m not suggesting that it will be cured with supplements but that this should be considered as part of a treatment plan.

katekagood-1691726759475500734.info,"I’ve had the thought for the last couple of months (it’s going to sound so morbid but stay with me), ‘Life is miserable enough as it is.’ What I mean is, life, at some point, is going to be miserable for everyone. Life does a great job of making things complicated, hard, stressful, and at making you feel bad about yourself. My point is, if life does that all by itself, without the help of anyone… why would you add to anyone’s misery, ever? Don’t worry – if there is someone you don’t like, no need to bash on them and make them feel even worse about things because life is already going to do the job for you. And because life can really just take it out of people, wouldn’t we want to just bolster people up? Then, I went and saw THE GREATEST SHOWMAN (❤️😍🎵❤️) and it solidified my thoughts. Aren’t we all “freaks” in some way or another? We are not perfect, we all have secrets, insecurities, and things we wish we could change. Instead of beating ourselves down (and taking those around us down too), I want to work more on building people up. I have been thinking of my New Year’s Resolution, and though I don’t really like resolutions because I’d like to think I’d do these things regardless, my goal is to work on gossiping less, even to a degree of bashing celebrities who don’t even know I exist (“her dress is disgusting…” as I sit in pj’s and judge). I am going to try to see the good in people and to stop talking (and reading) so much crap. I want to try to live by, ‘If that person was standing right in front of me, would I say those things?’ Probably not. So glad I got to see this amazing show that taught me so many great lessons! PS. Did you know that Hugh Jackman and his wife had several miscarriages through IVF and ended up adopting? And they are like the happiest people ever, so… there is hope for all of us “infertiles.” #behappy #thegreatestshowman #lifeismiserable #lifeisbeautiful #hope #ivf #hughjackman #deborraleefurness #newyearsresolution #thisisme",1515889566,17918378278061456,"I loved this show because it was beautiful to watch and listen to and had an awesome message.

I mean I don’t know if I even “adult” more than 4/7 of the week, sometimes I guess 5/7.....🤔 sometimes 2/7....ok that’s more than enough fractions for this time of the morning 🤦🏻‍♀️....I suppose not adulting every day is a good thing though, is it? One minute we’re being told to “grow up, get your shit together” and next minute were given the message “forever young” and “young wild and free” and “don’t grow up, it’s a trap” .....hard to work out whether to be an adult or just a carefree human some days. Well, with my 3, I’m hoping they grow up as the latter, the carefree human part. Get to explore the world their WHOLE LIVES!!!!! Not just for a week long yearly holiday their boss graciously allows them to go on, but all year round. The young wild and free part, I’m encouraging that forever!! I hope they get to 40 and think, I’ve done so much in my life, I could die tomorrow and feel like I’ve done it all!! And then do it all again until they’re 80. .

theflyingfitfoodie-1779973882770848478.info,"❓One of my most frequently asked questions is about how I meal prep when it comes to my trips. If you’re trying to watch what you eat or save money there are a couple of tricks I’ve learnt to make both of these a little easier when travelling. ✈️➡️
-
❌Firstly check if your destination allows you to bring in fresh food, otherwise you will be wasting your time and could potentially face hefty fines if you don’t declare it (USA, Australia,South Africa are no-gos for fresh items)
-
✅Pick foods that travel well - fruit in its skin like bananas and oranges are perfect just make sure they are protected from being squashed!
-
🍫Snacking bars - I never go away without a one! Protein bars are great  on the go snacks but pick wisely - most “healthy” breakfast and protein bars have stacks of hidden sugar.
-
🥗Prepping - it’s easy to pre make a salad but leave the dressing out until you’re ready to eat it to stop it from going soggy.
-
🥑I often take a small hass avocado with me on my flights to add to my salad if I don’t have a dressing (or if it leaked inside my bag, which often happens!)🙈
-
❓Do you have any neat little tips and tricks for healthy eating when you’re on the road or flying? I’d love to hear them!😊

brokemillennialblog-1876913923287730716.info,"This is probably one of the biggest (financial) ways Peach and I are different and that's okay. Our overall financial goals align, but he feels less stressed about the existence of his student loan debt than I do. Probably because he's been dealing with it for years. He (and now we) does pay more than 2x the minimum due, so the loans are not on the slow burn repayment schedule. He also shaved off thousands of dollars ahead of schedule by himself on a teacher's salary in NYC. I would just rather raid more of our savings to get rid of it today, which is more of an emotional move than a rational one.

What would you do? Pay it off aggressively by raiding savings/investments or focus on other money goals? ▫️

livinleggings-1948197837713769771.info,"It’s the second of Jan which means I am on my second day of #Veganuary and if I’m totally honest with you, I never set out doing this with the intention of only doing it for a month. More that I wanted to be able to turn vegan but I didn’t have the motivation or ‘bravery’ to start before now. This is my gentle way of giving it a go with a bit of a break out clause 😂 but one I sincerely hope I won’t be using. ⠀
I knew before I started that my weakness would be chocolate 🍫 (and cheese), so in an effort to ensure I don’t cave for a quick dairy filled sugar fix, I’ve been testing out some vegan baking! I’m never gunna make it as a good blogger as I simply never remember to photo anything before I eat it 🤣 but yesterday I baked a Banana Bread and due to popular demand on my stories, here’s the SUPER SIMPLE recipe!
⠀
🍞2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
🍞5 tablespoons water
⠀
Combine these to make an ‘egg’
⠀
🍞2 large ripe bananas - mashed
🍞1/3 cup applesauce
🍞2/3 cup brown sugar
🍞1/4 cup almond milk
🍞2 cups whole wheat flour
🍞1 teaspoon baking soda
🍞1/2 teaspoon salt
🍞3/4 cup chopped non-dairy chocolate chips
⠀
Vigorously stir together the bananas and apple sauce first, then add the sugar, almond milk and flax-eggs. 
Gently stir in the flour, baking soda and salt, finally add the choccie chips. ⠀
50 mins in the oven at 180C/350F. Boom! 💥 ⠀
Let me know if you make it and if you do, how long it lasts 😂 Mine didn’t even make 24 hours 🤣🤤

hannahvrose-1806130461043657303.info,"I want to write a bit about Instagram vs reality. It’s always spoken about, but I think very rarely we actually translate the thoughts proactively or through our actions. Instagram is a nice little curated version of people’s lives, and most often the very best parts- the posed, the edited and the filtered. .
.
You’d look at my feed and to a certain degree I guess you could think I have my life together. But, if I’m being completely and openly honest it’s a mess. My last year of uni especially has been a massive mental and physical struggle. I’ve had surgery, illnesses and more notably emotional struggles. Most of which has been left out, bar some. The tears, the lack of sleep and the sadness we all feel, often get swept to the side and ignored in public and online to save face. .
.
The thing is, I think we have to start being more vulnerable to accept vulnerability. When people constantly see positive, polished lives online they aspire to that, and often look for greener grass. But, some of the most polished people online can, in reality, be some of the most broken. By being honest and acknowledging that these problems aren’t failures and do not make us weak, I think a weight would be lifted and the pressure lightened.
.
.
I can’t tell you the amount of tears I have shed this year, the sadness I have felt and all of the sleepless nights. It may not seem like it because the things that we post are curated. I often feel like a fraud, but then again sometimes it’s nice to just forget your worries and find sanctuary online. What does everyone think? Is it a bad thing that we curate our online spaces? Should we be more honest so that we can all feel more comfortable being vulnerable? .
.
Ps. This post is brought to you by a girl who was dressed and about to go to the gym and then was summoned for a drink. I obviously couldn’t say no and that’s why this is a little late!😂",1529527550,17953876051016432,"I love how honest you are.

nest.out.west-2000918263726366330.info,"Have you shopped your home lately? My favorite part about this move has been putting all of our decor in one room (the basement for now) and organizing it the way a @homegoods store would be organized (only our version is much sloppier), and then shopping my home and coming up with new purposes for some of my favorite pieces. For example, these thrifted MCM cane-back chairs that I’ve had sitting in the entryway will most likely go in the kitchen nook and be used as dining chairs. Check out my stories to see what this space (the new home’s kitchen nook) currently looks like, and then you’ll see what we want to do with it! 🔨 //

erikaarff-1750427188781548159.info,"I'm cynical but have learned so much from being so. Before I adventure anywhere new, I try and understand the systems that I will be included in so I'm more aware of my actions within that ""specific society"". Travel is so hard. I don't think I've ever been anywhere in this world where I haven't been ""harmful"" but also ""beneficial"" to someone or something. On one hand, you are supporting a country's economic growth but at the stake of the people, environment or social systems that might be under distress. 
Luxury resort visits always leave me tossed with my emotions. We go so often that the workers have become family and people we genuinely love and support. Going back and spending the week with them brings my family so much love and joy. Our friendships have formed from years of mutual support to each other. However... the work hours and intensity they endure is difficult not to take note of. The pay is barely enough to live on and the tipping system (in my opinion) isn't quite fair (see future post). One of the managers also expressed the concern to recent shift to Airbnb, which has caused an decreased number of visitors to resorts and hotels all around the world. 
As Airbnb can help support a family, it takes away from thousands of workers who rely on the resorts to support their entire families. 
I'm not saying either is better or worse. I'm saying its important to look at ourselves and how we contribute to the systems we so easily cross into but rarely stay in. You may only be one person, and you may think your actions aren't effective but when there's thousands of us doing it, it becomes extremely effective.

Going on vacation is so lovely and relaxing but you can't help but feel like it's at someone else's expense. We are travelling to Greece in June and did a lot of research on the economic state (obviously among many other topics) and one of the suggestions online was to stay in Airbnbs and eat at local restaurants because your money will directly benefit the local economy, whereas if you were to stay in the Marriot for example, the cost of your stay mostly benefits a head quarters somewhere else. I've never stayed in an airbnb before, let alone in a tropical location, so I'm not sure about the pros and the cons,  but I think the fact that you think about these issues, in a genuine way, is one of the most important things you can do. Enjoy your vacations and appreciate the life we are blessed beyond words to live.

leotielovely-1721351198136513048.info,"Did you know that 'VEGAN' and 'PLANT-BASED' are not synonymous? Since publishing my most recent post on ""why I'm no longer a vegan"", I've been sent videos and publications to consider by few vegan eaters in friendly discussion of ideas and solutions to some of the problems each 'camp' faces. While I was watching a youtube which attempts to 'debunk' any arguments against veganism I noticed its creator, who had a lot of points to consider despite his folly, was using the two ways of eating synonymously in his arguments for veganism. ⚭  PLANT-BASED diets are usually centred around whole foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. They minimize (or abstain) from consumption of animal products and processed foods. So this could include a vegan, but not just vegans, as vegetarians, flexitarians, pescatarians, omnivores and so on can also have a plant-based diet. ⚭ VEGAN diets, as most people know, don't include any animal products, and try to avoid all products - food or otherwise - which are made with any animal associated ingredients; from meat and dairy, leather and wool ... to honey and the crushed up insects you find in L'oreal lipsticks. It doesn't necessarily mean they eat whole foods, it just means they don't eat animal products. ⚭  So, you could be a plant-based vegan, or a plant-based omnivore and be under the same diet 'umbrella' partially, so long as you're not eating (many / any) packaged processed foods and mostly eating plant-based products. ⚭  For me, 'plant-based' represents unity, a diet which reduces waste while reducing meat and dairy consumption simultaneously, and allowing for the nuances of each unique body, culture, class, community, season, and location. ⚭ To me, abstaining completely from any food group completely is a personal choice, what matters, is that we consume consciously and responsibly ... and are kind to each other in the process ... educating each other as best we can through friendly discussion, and solving the issues this world faces without pointing blame or excluding one another. 📷 @flaco_d_oro",1519421075,17901676555179088,"This is a fabulous way of explaining food choices. It shouldn't be a war or a competitionas long as your choices are moving the food industry towards a kinder direction. I personally believe in vegan objectives but I despite eating healthy I was still getting sick and my doctors advised me to eat a little meat and dairy. I'm so much healthier now. I'm 90% of the time vegan and dedicated to a fairer, kinder food system but alot of vegans or vegetarians would say that because I don't abstain from meat 100% I'm on the ""other"" side.",princessrubyrivera,1519447188,17927686252028325,"@leotielovely @princessrubyrivera I think another thing that I love about being a 90/10 ratio is that I get to show people that being healthy/plant based/sustainable doesn’t have to be all or nothing - there seems to be this “either you’re 100% or you’re failing” attitude which is just so unrealistic, so I enjoy challenging that ;)","@leotielovely @princessrubyrivera I think another thing that I love about being a 90/10 ratio is that I get to show people that being healthy/plant based/sustainable doesn’t have to be all or nothing - there seems to be this “either you’re 100% or you’re failing” attitude which is just so unrealistic, so I enjoy challenging that ;)",sustaininglife,1519506828,1,knowledge,56,hollyrose.eco,,,,,,left_only

raisingkarma-1993484145107911301.info,"Recently, I read an article that said we don’t have #friends anymore but #socialisers instead & #RealFriendship that lasts long hardly exists now. It ends with the question - Is this friendship forever?
.
Not surprisingly, I disagree!😜
.
A long time ago, I’d jotted a line to work into a poem later (never got around to it), but that line always stayed with me. It was based on some past romantic relationships & I feel it applies to friendships too.
.
▪️Just because it didn’t last forever... doesn’t mean it wasn’t real!▪️
.
Somehow, somewhere, we’ve gotten very tied up with the concept of anything real being permanent or forever. And that really doesn’t make sense to me. Let me explain it in this context.
.
Thanks to growing up across the country & then my work in different places, I have many different groups of friends. I’m in regular touch with some & not with others. However, I have memories with all.🙂
.
Does that mean the people I’m not in touch with weren’t real friends then?🤔Even the ones who came up to me when I was the new kid in my first civilian school & felt so out of place & then we sat together in class everyday for the rest of the year? Or the ones I cried to about my first heartbreak? Or the ones, who after years of not being in touch, reached out to me during a very big loss in my life?
.
I’ve also had falling-outs with some people but I maintain that despite us not being ‘friends’ anymore, the time we had together can’t be termed as anything other than #TrueFriendship. The fact that it didn’t last forever doesn’t take away from what we had together - the good times & bad ones where we were there for each other. It doesn’t lessen their value as friends.🤗
.
Or the peeps you meet for only crazy parties or movies or coffee... Hey, good moments are as imp! You’ll remember those stories. Letting your hair down with friends is not any less relevant than a ❤️to❤️ talk.
.
Life is made up of moments & no moment lasts forever. But they’re real thanks to the people in them whether they’re around till you’re 90 or not!💡
.
Does quantity of time really trump quality here? Is that the defining parameter of a real friendship? I think not!😊

I had a lovely time talking all about the perfect palette whilst eating biscuits and drinking tea with a really lovely designer wanted to build her confidence around colour.

We got to talking about some really interesting subjects, specifically trends within design and I would love to hear your thoughts too. Personally, I don't see anything wrong with trends but I don't like fads. What I mean by that is if a trend has a classic element to it which means it will last longer than six months I am all for it, what I don't like is design that looks great for a month but then you start to see it absolutely everywhere and suddenly it becomes really boring!

I also love to wait until the trend is completely over and everyone hates it before I adopt it myself!

loveandsundays-1853015335755425713.info,"Days with my Bae...
.
I’ve had a few messages asking about my experience recovering from my elective c-section and a few asking why I chose to have a c-section vs a VBAC this time
.
When I had Mía I was unprepared for a c-section (for some reason it never crossed my mind that I would end up with one) and so I was incredibly unprepared for the recovery from one. I had a few stitches open, an infection and it was several weeks before I could comfortably walk around the block. The immobility, sleepless nights and raging hormones all contributed to my PPD... and it was a rough time. I try and think back on those first 6 months and realize what a fog I was in and how I was t present emotionally or mentally for Mía’s newborn time.
.
This time I chose to have an elective c-section and planned for extra support and help after so I didn’t feel overwhelmed with recovery, a newborn and a toddler to tend to. I thought I would have a similar experience in terms of recovering physically but it has been totally different. I was in a lot less pain afterwards, was able to walk around the block within 4-5 days after coming home and was way more mobile so I could care for Aría.
.
Emotionally, I don’t feel as overwhelmed as I did the first time... probably because I know what to expect. I have less anxiety around having the task of caring for a tiny human and I have put less pressure on myself to do everything on my own. Do I still feel sad? Yes, that comes with the hormones but I am way more aware of my feelings and more open to talking about them to Jon and others this time and it’s so helpful...
.
I feel more present mentally and emotional for Aría’s newborn months and for Mía’s transition into her role as a Big Sister... but I do feel guilty for not being as present for Mía’s newborn months... I suppose that is the struggle in motherhood! #honestmotherhood #ppd",1535116663,17976379525004690,"I had an emergency c-section with my son and couldn’t agree more with your description of the days, weeks and months afterwards.

My interior design preferences are a constant battle between my love for muted, neutral, natural tones (as found in our living room), and my equal love for bright colours (like the shelves of books in our reading room). I've dealt with this so far by using blues, greys and ivories in the main part of the ground floor (living, dining and kitchen) and filling the kids' playroom and reading room on the other side of the house with colour.

So, it's a pretty great coincidence that we were planning this post, our third to help address tsoureki overload, so close to this... holiday? national day? what are these days called?  In any case, any day that celebrates melty gooey cheese and crispy grilled bread is a great day!

Head on over to our blog to learn what else goes into this Greek version of a classic sandwich, and to learn how we ensure that the tsoureki gets as deliciously crisp as possible.

THEN i picked this pretty girl up from school and as i walked up another little girl was biting the crap out of her leg. i ran, scooped her up and my heart just shattered. can I just buy a bubble? 😭

August 2014: @britaxus is launching a brand new convertible car seat line! Their #ClickTight technology has been expanded into their convertible car seats! If you're not familiar with the #Britax seats that utilize this feature, it makes it much easier for a parent or caregiver to install using the vehicle seatbelt system. The Lower Anchor weight limits are being limited by NHTSA to a combined weight of 65 lbs (weight of child + weight of car seat), meaning you'll need to switch from using the LATCH system to using the vehicle seat belt to secure your child's car seat. NOTE: Be careful not to over tighten the seatbelt before closing the ClickTight system.",1535145746,17958759106129460,"@britaxus if you don’t have one already, you should do a video of how to install a clicktight on a plane.

Years ago we decided that if we were in a position to help others save a ton of money on the most-expensive thing they own, that we would. We’ve done that over the past 8 years by helping a few hundred of my followers save a ton of money refinancing or financing their new home when Brady was a Home Loan Officer. But now that Brady has moved over to the Real Estate side of things, we have even more room to give back to those that Brady has as clients!🙌🏻💰
.
🌟If any of you are looking for a Real Estate Agent to help you buy or sell a home, we decided to offer another exclusive deal.
.
✨If you use Brady as your Real Estate Agent to Buy or Sell a Home in the state of Utah, he will give you a $1000 Gift Card to any store!😱(Target, Amazon, Best Buy, etc) If you Buy AND Sell with Brady as your Real Estate Agent, you will get TWO $1000 Gift Cards after closing!👏🏻
.
If you have questions, want to use Brady as an agent, or just want more info, feel free to email Brady directly at bradyj@ranlife.com. If you would like to text him instead, DM me here on Instagram and I can give you his number so you can reach out!
.
To get the deal, you must contact him by November 2nd, 2018—even if you might not need his help for a few months.
.

benparkes-1731076675238071676.info,"Yesterday’s easy 10k only took 5 hours to complete!! What was meant to be a super simple solo run yesterday turned into a bit of a mess, when after 5k I was getting bad stomach pains, no doubt related to my hernia.. bent over in pain, I couldn’t carry on. 🤢
.
So had to head to the nearest bus stop and get myself home. 🚌 Oh this last month has been super tough! .
Still it gave me some time to work on my training plans (marathon and half marathon plans are now on www.benparkes.com) 📝 and get an early night. 💤 .
But as the night went on the pain subsided and just after 10pm I headed out to try and finish that 10k.  A little tempo session was in order to get the legs firing again, 17:48 for the 5k was ok.. ✅ . 
What’s the morale here? For me it’s just accepting that the world will throw you a bad hand every now and then, hernias, injuries, pulled muscles and everyone around you on social media appears to be running amazingly! It’s tough! . 
But believe me, running is sooooo hard, everyone is going through difficult times, just try and focus on yourself and not worry how social media can make it all seem so easy!  We are all going through the same, believe me! 👍🏻 #runnerproblems #marathontraining #londonmarathon #seenonmyrun #manchestermarathon #timetofly #hokaoneone #runnersofinstagram",1520580442,17921631292073324,"Social media and Strava are tough mistresses.

I was spending too much time worrying about how my weekly mileage compared to everyone else's... how fast did they go... how early did they get up?

thesundaygirluk-1814639604583063973.info,"I've realised I'm greedy when it comes to base products. Like cake I don't want just one type, I'd rather sample them all and that's probably why I'm the (self appointed) Queen of mixing products together. Today's custom blend may have been a little too heavy for the heat wave but one I'd definitely revisit. ▪️YSL Touché Eclat Primer - this is one to apply with your finger tips. Anything else and the glitter effect can be a little over the top. ▪️YSL Touché Eclat Foundation combined with Giorgio Armani Face Fabric Foundation with a few drops of my trusty Sephora Radiant Luminious Drops creates the most pretty yet luminous air brush finish.
▪️L'Oréal Infaillible Foundation Stick in Espresso as a contour - Blends like a dream. ▪️L'Oreal Infaillible Blush Stick in Rosy Nude - if at all possible a prettier version of NARS Orgasm. ▪️Bobbi Brown Bronzing Powder in Elvis Duran with D&G The Bronzer in place of eyeshadow. Seriously bronzer makes the best neutral wash of eye colour. ▪️Anastasia Bev Hills Peach Nectar Illumintator - again more of an eyeshadow choice in my hands than anything else. ▪️Maybelline Brow Precise - a strong contender for my favourite brow product of all time. It is up there with Glossier Boy Brow and Benefit Gimme Brow. Seriously

More than a 100 of these islands are developed exclusively for tourism with one resort per island. Each island observes a different time to make the most out of the evening light.

We played outside in the rain and I felt like a little kid again splashing in the puddles and sailing float planes down the curb! Also, I want to say thanks to @thegracefulolive for her inspiring blog post about throwing your kids toys out. If I think about it I get sentimental, but I've been going absolutely ludicrous over the little toys sprawled out everywhere that the only purpose they serve, is to be sprawled out everywhere!!! So I just did it! I went through the toys and got rid of lots of cars, figurines, and McDonald's toys and put them away for us to donate. We've all been so much happier and it's amazing how much my house is instantly cleaner even when they pull everything off the shelf! So do yourself a favor, if you've been tired of the clutter, just do it. Just throw it out! (Or donate) I actually loved talking to Arrow about how we are blessed with so many toys already that we are going to give some away for other kids to play with. And you know what!? She was totally ok with that! How sweet are these precious babes!?

Cuddles with me. Smiles with me. Laughs with me and say's DAD and looks in my eyes like I am his whole world. Being a father has made me question my whole being and made me grow in ways I did not even know I needed too. Being a father is a blessing. Being Daijon's Dad is everything. I love you son! ❤

On another note, father related activities and content is wayyyyyyyy under represented, from the healthcare system all the way to change tables in public washrooms (which we do not use, germaphobes) to content on the internet that focuses only on Moms. Don't me wrong, I was raised by a single Mom, love you Mom and Moms including my awesome wife @foodforlove99 who is a Mom. Long story short, I am going to talk about being a father on my podcast and platforms. It is important. So many great fathers out there.

Type or tag a father with a few words that describe him and show some love! ❤🙏🏽

rosemarymaccabe-1803932727303320070.info,"A big part of why I talk about my mental illness so openly - and so often - is that it's really important to break down the stigma around it. Depression isn't something to feel ashamed of; it doesn't make you ungrateful or narcissistic or self-centred, or any of those insults you throw at yourself when you're feeling low, and like you don't deserve compassion. We are all worthy of empathy and understanding and, until the entire world gets on board, it's going to be up to those of us who can afford to expend the energy doing it to keep talking about our mental illness and offering a hand to those who still haven't found a way to speak up. (By that same token, there are times when I find it too exhausting to talk about my depression. There are times when I find it too exhausting to deal with anyone else's depression. Just because I speak out about my struggles doesn't mean I owe anyone else my time or energy - I am not a psychiatrist and I'm not an expert. Right now, I'm just a person, trying to figure it all out, wearing a Jen Gotch x Bando necklace in the hopes of starting up some conversations.)

ameliafreer-1604380318336562651.info,"Before I disappear for a while on maternity leave, I wanted to say a few words about the ongoing controversy of 'clean eating' that I frequently find myself dragged into. In a world where stories sell, the topic of 'clean eating' has become a vehicle for media controversy. Without wading into the debate itself, or making this personal to any detractors, I would simply like to say that there is a sensible, middle ground: on the one hand, healthy, balanced and nutritionally dense diets are irrefutably important for long-term health; on the other hand, unrealistic, hyper-inflated, nutritionally restricted diets based on bad science (particularly when accompanied by imagery that promotes an unhealthy relationship with our bodies) are undeniably damaging – particularly as we are now exposed to such messages in unprecedented volumes, especially here on social media.  Given these potential risks, I always try my best to present you with evidence-based information, alongside plenty of food inspiration and ideas, which help you to make informed decisions about the nutritional choices that feel right for you. But nobody is perfect, and the status quo of scientific conclusion regularly changes its mind – therefore my views have, and will continue to shift and grow with changing evidence. This is simply a reflection of the continual learning required to work in any sort of scientific career. And also the ongoing learning for how best and conscientiously to use social media, something I am still grappling with. For more on the challenges we are all up against when looking at nutritional science, I found a fantastic infographic via @parsleyhealth - the link is in my profile. As an industry, the responsibility of promoting good nutrition must be taken very seriously. But good nutrition does still matter – perhaps now more than ever. I hope you will not lose sight of this truth amongst the maelstrom of debate.",1505477059,17898214606063648,Followed your 10 day plan and I feel so much better.

secretsofjessica-1777675292643442985.info,"The month of May is #skincancerawareness month🌞. I share these pictures to show how the most unsuspecting pink spot can be very harmful.  I’m not a doctor, but I’ve had my share of skin cancers. Here is what I’ve learned and will share with you 
1. If you see a new “spot”, don’t dismiss it. If you have an old “spot” and it begins to change, don’t dismiss it. 🙅🏼‍♀️If you have something that is scaly, bleeds, itches... I feel it’s your body’s way of screaming at you to seek attention!! Find a good doc and have it looked at. 
2. Wear sunscreen. Everyday. Year round. It’s not for beach days, it’s for all days🌥. I know many of you are thinking it “feels gross” on your face. You’re using the wrong sunscreen. Get one that feels nice, unscented, and is UVA and UVB protection. I like  elta MD. 
3. Make sun hats👒, sun umbrellas⛱, and the shade your best friend. When you’re outside stay covered. I wear a long sleeved rashguard on the beach. Avoid getting any color! If you want a sun kissed look, get a spray tan, or use a bronzing lotion. They make some amazing products. And, your skin will thank you by looking years younger 2 decades from now. 💁🏼‍♀️
4. Lastly, and most importantly, make sure you have an AWESOME dermatologist 👩🏻‍⚕️👨🏼‍⚕️. In my opinion, a good dermatologist will give you a through skin check. If they “glance” at you... go elsewhere. Be your own advocate. Make sure you’re getting the best care.

alicemaypurkiss-2013074682103194042.info,"I know tattoos aren’t for everyone, but I knew fairly early on in my cancer diagnosis (even when I was totally tattoo free) that I wanted a mastectomy tattoo and that want only increased with every time they cut me open to operate on the breast where a tumour had made itself at home. I have seen so many ugly iterations of what was left behind and a tattoo is a way for me to deal with the many, many tears I shed over the breast that used to exist. The battle ground left behind by cancer has been turned into something beautiful. It sounds strange to mourn for a body part and to grieve for a body that let me down and a life that would be no better or worse than the life I have now, but grieve I did. Grieve I have. Grieve I do.
Getting this tattoo was a chance to take ownership of that experience and take some control back of my body. The feather represents my life as a writer which has only grown as a result of my cancer experience, and the process of moving forward, while the words underneath “to live would be an awfully big adventure” is a reminder to myself that even on the hard days, whatever life throws at us, there is adventure and joy to seek. And there is always hope. And if in doubt, there’s always Hook.
Thank you to the inimitable @domholmestattoo for turning the idea I had into such a gorgeous reality. Dom recognised the importance of this moment for me and treated it with the gravity, care and attention I needed to mark the process. She also has really great music taste and excellent chat, so I’d very much recommend her if you’re looking for a London tattoo artist.
Finally feel like maybe, just maybe, I’m a step closer to healing. And this tattoo has been a massive part of this.
How lucky I am to be alive and how grateful I am to keep trying to do the best I can every single day. Who knows how long the adventure will be. Who knows if cancer will make a comeback. But I’m going to keep trying my best forever.

I’ll also be doing Instagram Lives, taking you on field trips to @gothamgreens ,  @paulinameatmarket , @dirksfish and @middleeastbakery. And in celebration of the takeover, I want to give you a sneak peek at who’s sweetening the week for current followers, as well as new ones joining from @Whole30Recipes -- @Vitamix, Staub and Zwilling! It's clear that our world needs a lot more kindness — how are you spreading kindness in your life or what kindness has been shown to you?",1518904467,17869180339211233,"Sooo good!

This has only made me more determined - I feel as though I’ve time travelled backwards a couple of years to when I was originally fighting my way to target, always struggling with the scales 🤷🏻‍♀️ it never gets easier... but if you keep going, you get there eventually!

🌿Coast Sydney Botanicals Renew Facial Serum Oil* — This facial oil is really hydrating and rich. If you have dry skin or are looking for something really hydrating and nourishing, this might be for you! The oil packs a punch, it contains rosehip oil, seabuckthorn, rose geranium, frankincense, carrot seed oil and immortelle oil. I only use this at night whenever my face is feeling very dehydrated or dry. I think I will get more uses out of this during the fall/winter!
🌿Coast Sydney Botanicals Purify Facial Serum* — This serum feels like a dry oil and it is suited for oily/acne prone skin types. The oil contains blue tansy and is high in Azulene, which helps reduce redness and calm irritated skin. I really enjoy using this because my skin is less oily throughout the day and it helps calm blemishes 🙌

⠀
How can we do this to one another? Why is any of this happening? What kind of world will our children live in? ⠀
⠀
These questions have been weighing heavy on my heart. I've become scared of what is happening to humanity and what the future holds for us. ⠀
⠀
Then, I came across this quote: ⠀
""You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty."" - Gandhi⠀
⠀
I needed a little reminder that while there are those in the world who may be evil and choose to hate, there are more who are good and choose love. ⠀
⠀
So today let's have courage, stay positive, be kind, and choose love ❤️ ⠀

Most of the home’s we’ve looked at have poorly done add-ons and extensions, where the renovations we would want to make were going to cost a minimum of $400k!  Our dream home would have a yard for our dog, a pool with a large first step for the baby, lots of natural light, an open concept where the kitchen opens into the family room… oh and a cute key west exterior like this one wouldn’t hurt 😜. We both work from home, so compromising on our dream home isn’t something either of us is really willing to do… Which is why I’m so excited we found out about Unison HomeBuyer which makes it so much easier to get into our dream home (once we find it!) by contributing at least half of the down payment! Meaning less debt and risk for everyone and you don’t have to make significant compromise to achieve your dream home 😍
✨
✨
Y’all… the housing market is rough - seriously according to a report from realtor.com only 41% of American can afford a home! Unison and Atomic Research conducted a survey to find out what people would be willing give up in order to own a home and found that across generations and genders, the majority of people admittedly prefer engaging in a relationship with a current homeowner! Over half of those surveyed said they’d be more likely to date or marry someone who already own a home when they started dating! We should be able to feel like we can land our dream home regardless of a partner already having one! ✨

Kids dress up at Halloween. People wear stupid ignorant crap ALL the time. Have you ever been to a luau party or Hawaiian party and worn a fake lay and maybe even the fake green grass skirt? That is absolutely not a panic and could be taken as offensive. People are going to order real late is in order real to leave skirts to wear for a luau parties. Furthermore they did go to an Indian store and purchased their middle eastern Indian garb from an Indian man who said he would sell them as much as he could. In fact he said he would tell them they looked gorgeous and everything so he can keep selling more. Anybody wants to get angry at anyone you should get mad at him because he is from the middle east and should know how to dress a woman correctly. As far as Monica coming interesting like an American Indian... well like Forrest Gump said stupid does it stupid is. You open a box of chocolates and you never know what you're going to get. That's Monique. She tried to play it off like she knew what she was doing and everyone knows she just made a really stupid mistake. Honestly though in the scheme of things... after a few drinks who cared? Reallymean comments are why people that go to costume parties don't want to get dressed up. The next time you have a costume party and I don't come dressed up blame yourself. You're criticizing everyone that came to this party at least silly enough to dress up... by the time you reach your 50s tell me if you feel like dressing up for a party by then to?!? Probably not. Good for these ladies to know how to throw a fun party. My recommendation to do that got really offended by what they were wearing... write a book on what not to wear at an Indian party.

I just want to say thank you so much for all the love on my new dining room the other night but also to tell you more about my stunning @dar_lighting Ilario pendant light from @castlegate_lights.

As @christal_joan wrote in the blogpost: ""I know we don’t often look at the lives of the Prophets (as) and think of the word failure, but their lives were filled with hardships. Each and every one of them experienced hardships relating to perceived failures but because of their mindsets, they all overcame them to reach the ultimate success.""
#PerspectiveShift
.
.
Prophetic Examples like Adam (عليه السلام) – handling failure of one’s own soul as a human being, Nuh (عليه السلام) – handling children's failure as a parent, Ibrahim (عليه السلام) – handling parent’s failure as a child and Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) – handling community’s failure as a leader...
.
.
What other examples can you mention when you think of turning failure into success through the power of shifting one's perspective and mindset? 💞
.

Any examples from the lives of prophets or even companions are most welcome 👇🏽

This has got to be one of the prettiest resorts I’ve stayed in #bali. The pool area and beach frontage is just spectacular, particularly at night when the whole resort lights up. The rooms are old fashioned Balinese style (currently being renovated) but are large, clean and comfy. Nusa Dua is certainly not as cheap as other areas of the island and whilst we got a fabulous deal on the accommodation at @ayodyabali through @luxuryescapes (about $150/room/night inc brekky and a couple of extra dinners, discounts etc) the food in the hotel is Aussie restaurant prices. Luckily there are plenty of cheap restaurants just outside the hotel and @balicollection_nd is only a 10 minute walk away. We stay at Nusa Dua as the surf is amazing in January here, so it keeps the surfers happy and I’m happy with a sun lounge and a good book or podcast. If you’re considering #ayodyabali I’d recommend requesting a room close to the beach, as it’s a huge resort and you could be up for a 400 metre walk to the beach if you’re at the back. #notsponsored #iwish #nusadua #baligasm #ilovebali #balibuddies #baliresort #baliholiday #baliforfamilies",1548319938,17951420791239231,Thanks for the great review and all your posts of Ayodya - we are booked to stay at Ayodya in July,tng_06,1548320651,18009781408107261,@tng_06 oh you’ll love it Tarryn.

daniellepascente-1872729601345385891.info,"Do you use a watch/tracker?? If so, which one?!
••
As you guys know I'm an Apple watch LOVER (hence my really awesome tan line years in the making). If you haven't had a chance to see it - you're missing out😂
••
I have the OG apple watch though and I haven't needed to upgrade for any reason until now. I'll tell you why.
••
I've always thought my apple watch was slightly off with tracking my runs. It was confirmed when I ran the Surf City 1/2 Marathon back in February. When I got to each mile marker it was roughly .1 off. So when I hit mile 1, it was at .90 instead of 1. When I got to 13.1, it was still at like 11 some odd miles🙄
••
So yes, I've literally been running MORE than I need to daily.
••
To my defense, I did a hard reset on it after that race and thought I fixed it. WELP - it wasn't until this past weekend I realized it was COMPLETELY OFF again when I did treadmill runs.
••
Not only was my mileage WAY OFF (more than just .1), but my pacing has been off too.
••
TRUTH: I ALWAYS thought I was running way faster than my watch said. I've told my running friends this, I've told Matt this 100 times. Like every time I get back from what I thought was a super speedy run, my watch still says I'm in the upper 9's, lower 10's. My heart felt more like mid to low 8's but maybe I was imagining🤣🤷🏼‍♀️
••
Anyway, this weekend was 100% confirmation that my watch is way off. Instead of doing another hard reset, I honestly just would rather get a new one. After all, I'm still on the OG version of the Apple watch.
••
So my question to you guys - does anyone have the new apple watch and do you like it?? I'm hesitant to switch brands because I love the apple watch but I will hear you out in the comments if you have one your really like.
••
Please keep in mind I do a TON of cross training, strength training, circuit training, etc. I want to be able to track this too. I don't use ANY of the additional functions. I don't want text messages, phone calls, none of that. I just want to use it for workouts.
••
Until then, I'm just going to keep running a mile less than my watch says because apparently I've been running a zillion more miles than I need to😅

erikaarff-1721885179154306939.info,"Hey guys me again. As much as I try and act like shit doesn't phase me, it does. I'm working on it and am getting good at using my tools and resources for when shit gets too real. Long story short- I got some pretty rude comments in my DM earlier this week after being vocal towards a diabetes joke made by someone with many of followers. One guy asked if I was confusing my type 1 with type 2 because I was a ""fat ass"". Other messages included tips on how I should remove myself from the diabetic community and backlash on how I overreacted.  I was rattled because I'm proud of what I've decided to do with my disease.  Four years ago I wouldn't have spoken up against people who made jokes towards us. As much as I try not to listen, an overwhelming amount of negativity can deff get to you even in a small way. So I took a couple of days to rid the negativity and fill my heart with people who matter. People freaking suck sometimes. But I met two elders at the park the other day who melted my heart into liquid butter. And I took the girls' new au pair to see her first WA sunset. And read a book. And listened to a shit ton of Latin music. And as much as I was feeling the negativity, it forced me to remove myself and focus on the shit that fuels my fire.

allmumstalk-1842348621846377519.info,"Hi, I’m Aly, I’m an emigrant - actually two weeks ago I became British, but that’s not important as I’m still fighting the usual stereotypes. Well, there’s an undeniable accent, every day I’m asked the initially innocent ‘where are you from’ question, some people are surprised, others immediately start making assumptions about my education, family upbringing and try to find out why I left my country for the UK. I politely reply - it was for studies - i came here many years ago to do a masters programme in Birmingham - but then there’s the other annoying question: are you planning to stay or...return to your home country...🙄 Define home! Why would this matter? I’m raising two bilingual kids who are already a challenge because they aren’t coming from the same society I grew up with, but there’s more to their roots they need to grasp now and in the future. That’s a subject for another time. I’m also a working mum, supporting working mums as much as I can, especially mums who started a new scary project after having a child. 
Instagram is not my full time job (actually I don’t even see it as a job), I do endorse brands that I’m genuinely using in my family life, but I’m also talking about family businesses that need a shout-out. I do like to share more of the pretty pixels, more than my morning eye circles after 3h of sleep. I am also a full time mum while working full time hours when they nap/ play/ sleep/ eat and I don’t have any help. Not because I can’t afford some but because I still feel I can do this. My mum did it, i should be able to do it too. I recently bought a family business I’ve used up my all my savings on, trying to make it work while managing a buggy, a buggy board, a bike or a scooter and 2 bags of orders from the shop and back; I’m fortunate enough I have a smart and supportive husband who is working long hours to make sure we can afford things. And I’m aware we can afford more than many other people, we can afford a bank loan to get an electric car- not to show off or try to be different, but because pollution is a real issue we can do so much about - but that’s another story for another time. More below...",1533845092,17860691575276721,"I'm sorry you are still being asked are you staying or going back. That shouldn't be happening. I'm sorry you feel you have to justify yourself. I know people say that to me but sometimes I feel it needs to be said to rid myself of those doubters. I am not a mum, and that is my choice, but I am in awe of your strength to be a full time mum, business owner and so much more. I hope you are managing some self care as well?

theinspiredroom-1855952899776107934.info,"Happy Tuesday! What’s on your agenda for the day? I know we’ve all got so much going on. Getting kids back to school, Instagram scrolling, work, laundry? 😬
.
But what about your dreams? Don’t let your own dreams die while fears, daily distractions, disappointments, or a perceived lack of time / skill / confidence pull you away from progress. (And it’s never too late and you’re never too old to chase dreams!)
.
You know that saying, ‘do it scared?’ That’s me, except I need all the pep talks and encouragement in order to muster my courage. I often feel too paralyzed or overwhelmed to do anything, let alone do it scared. But even when all we hear are crickets, we can’t let the silence or darkness stifle our own voice. 💗
.
Your dreams might be on top of the mountain in front of you, seemingly so far from your grasp. That’s often where they are! Keep the whole picture of success in mind to propel you to keep going. It’s the baby steps up the mountain, the daily commitment to make progress and celebrate the small victories that will get you there. ⛰
.
You might be moving inch by inch, or one step forward falling two steps back, but it’s allllll a part of the journey! Even the cliffs you have to navigate are going to serve you well as you will only grow stronger and braver for it (so praying is a good first step 😁).
.
Doing it scared may be the thing that inspires someone else to do the same, so do it so we can all believe in what’s possible. We need you!
.
Whatever dream is brewing in your heart, you’ve got this! You’ll know I’m over here with coffee in hand this morning, cheering you on and doing things scared, too. 🙌🏻☕️ 💗 #thewhitebrickcottage

fitbyfifty.us-1958872686155536924.info,"#throwbackthursday post plus a message so PLEASE READ to the end 😉. Part 1:
This photo was at my 2nd #fitnesscompetition , Ms. Galaxy 1996 and I’m standing next to my biggest role model, Sherry Goggin.  Back in the old days, when a loaf of bread 🥖 was only 5 cents .... lol😂jk... back then we had no internet or social media but I was buying every fitness magazine on the store racks and read them from front to back for information and #inspiration . There were always articles and photo shoots with fitness girls that inspired me , but Sherry was my fave 🙌. Within a couple years I was preparing for my first competition , obtained sponsorship , hired a gymnastics coach , then built an obstacle course , worked with an Olympic athlete trainer, hired a personal trainer and nutrition coach and ended up competing in CA with none other than this woman who I really looked up to and, and who unknowingly gave me that last little push I needed to try something I’ve never done before! 🙏🏻Now, PART 2:  Had I #compared myself to anyone else back then I probably would never have competed .  I was a lot smaller than most competitors (swipe to see an example ).... not just a lot shorter but pretty skinny , and had a hard time actually putting weight and bulk muscle on.  I probably didn’t really fit the mold of a competitor but I didn’t care .  My goal was to be the best version of me that I could.  I worked my ass off (literally I think 😂) just like any other competitor , and I accomplished my own personal #goals which is something I will forever be proud of!  So the message is, seek all the inspiration you can , it’s great to be inspired by others but don’t compare yourself or strive to be exactly like them.  Embrace your uniqueness and just work on being the best version of YOU ! 💖. We are all blessed with the opportunity to try our best !💪. I hope you all have an awesome day and do something that makes you feel good EVERY DAY ! 😘❤️❌⭕️

Before you decide I’m a miserable grinch and unfollow, don’t worry, I absolutely adore Christmas but I like to keep it all concentrated into one month so I  REALLY feel the spirit. 
For me it gets a bit diluted if I start the season in November; plus I’d hate to think I was wishing my life away. But as soon as December dawns I start embracing all things Christmas🎄with a passion. 
Anyway, it was good to actually look at food with an appetiteladt night and enjoy a G&T after a week of lurghi. 
The winter sun’s out this morning so we’re going to attempt a bike ride. Hoping my legs work! 
Have a wonderful Saturday 😘

sparklesandstretchmarks-1832174196232751839.info,"When I started to embrace the body positivity movement earlier this year - I took baby steps. To begin with I started to introduce more colour to my usually-dark wardrobe. Then I slowly started to free myself from the self-imposed fashion rules I’d lived by for years - one silly rule at a time. No showing the tops of my arms? Psh! Out came the strappy vests! Once I felt ok with that, I moved on to the next rule. No showing my legs above the knee? Sod that, pass me the shorts! But there was ONE rule I always told myself I’d NEVER be able to break. And that was getting my tummy out. 
No amount of body positivity or neutrality was ever going to make me feel comfortable enough to wear a bikini or a crop top in public, I was 1000% confident of that. 
Well...here I am...6 months down the line...wearing a crop top. It might only be showing a tiny bit of tummy but it’s more than I EVER thought I’d be ok with. And you know what the weirdest part is? I didn’t feel self conscious at all. Not even slightly! Because I know now that it’s perfectly ok that not all stomachs look the same - and that just because mine is round and covered in stretch marks and has rather a lot of loose skin after 3 c sections in 3 years - it doesn’t make it a thing of shame. I’m actually ok with it just how it is. Do I LOVE it?! No. But I’m ok with it. And that’s enough for now. 
As for whether I’ll be able to brave a bikini, that bit remains to be seen! 
It’s ok if your body acceptance journey is a slow work in progress...never beat yourself up about your capability to love yourself, we live in a society that constantly tells us that we’re not good enough as we are - it makes it REALLY hard to love and accept your body as it is. It’s  better to be working toward loving yourself slowly than not doing it at all. #effyourbodystandards #effyourbeautystandards",1532632205,17890347649234568,You look lovely and you’re a lot braver than me.

melyssa_saves-1948109289503975104.info,"This morning I was whining to my husband about the fact that when I left for the gym at 4:30AM it was negative five degrees outside. Painfully cold! 🥶He laughed and said, “It could be worse. You could be sitting outside the ER in negative sixteen degree weather. Count your blessings, dear.”
-
You see almost four years ago I took a job at the hospital ER valeting cars in the middle of the night. It was by far the most interesting (sometimes awful) job I’ve ever had. One night in particular sticks out in my memory as being down right miserable. It was the middle of winter. Utah had a record breaking cold snap and at 10PM it was negative sixteen degrees. The ER was PACKED. I was super busy. I was stationed outside the doors of the ER in a folding metal chair next to my only source of heat that had run out of propane. My feet were so wet and cold they were frozen and I must have looked absolutely miserable because as the police escorted a homeless man in cuffs into the building (the mildest of the most interesting things we saw during the wee hours at the ER), he looked at me, laughed and said “It sucks to be you!! HA!” 😂 -
-
But I’ll tell ya what, I’ve never been so grateful for such a miserable job in my entire life. Two months prior to taking this job my little family had just paid off the last of our $119,700 in debt! And we had decided that the time had finally come to purchase a home. Having been through what we went through, we knew that in order to take on this next step responsibly we needed to go into it as financially sound as possible. We set a goal to save a 30% down payment on a home. In order to fast track that, I would need to find a temporary job outside our home that still allowed me to be at home with my babies during the day. -

Enter the ER valet position. It paid well and the hours worked out perfectly. I could make the most of the rest. And I did. For a whole 15 months. It was the best and the worst job I have ever had.

We had to downsize our dining table (I’m still crying internally - I really loved that table!) and move furniture around to get our space balance right. But for what?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Oh, you know! Just so we could pop in a massive play pen and a basketball hoop in the mix. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀As parents and as lovers of our cosy home, we do as much as we can to tuck everything away, but if there’s one thing that still sticks out like a sore thumb, it’s Zara’s stroller. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀It lives behind our front door when not in use and is a pain (literally 😔) when I have to wedge myself into the house with grocery bags because the door can only swing open halfway. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀But you know what? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Guess I’m not the only parent facing this problem because someone clearly created the Dreambaby®StrollAway® to fix this! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Zara’s stroller hangs neatly behind our door when not in use now and we no longer have to Spider-Man our way into the house. Swipe to look at the difference it’s made! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Check out the ingenius range of new products by @dreambabysafety in conjunction with Big W’s ‘Baby Week’ promotion running August 2-16th!

ayeina_official-1864485022195645510.info,"CHALLENGE # 02 - DECLUTTERING 🚮 #PreRamadanProductivityCourse
.
.
In personal development category of the Productivity Journal, we've chosen to work on a *DECLUTTER PLAN* for this month.
.
.
In the last challenge (praying on time), most people said that they struggle with focus during their salah. So decluttering seemed like a good choice for the next challenge. 
We all have this inherent capacity to focus, right? But at the same time, attention is a limited resource. Not only should we be aware of this, but treat it as such: something most valuable.
.
.
The more we own, the more we are consumed. Minimalism is a way to escape the excesses of the world around us — the excesses of consumerism, material possessions, clutter, having too much to do, too many distractions, too much noise. But too little meaning. It is a way of eschewing the non-essential in order to focus on what’s truly important, what gives our lives meaning. And most importantly, what takes us closer to jannah.
.
.
So this week, your challenge is to take out things that you don't use anymore. Things that only take space in your home but don't serve you in any way - so you don’t give them the power to constantly consume your mind unnecessarily. Because after a certain point, material objects have a tendency to crowd out the emotional needs they are meant to support.
.
.
The challenge is to decrease the physical clutter in your surroundings that competes for your attention, resulting in decreased performance and increased stress.

All that time spent dealing with our belongings can overload our senses, impairing our ability to focus and think. 
And for a believer, reflection is a huge part of life! 
It's no wonder we feel constantly overwhelmed as the things we own start to own us! We not only constantly consume but we also get consumed by our things day in and day out!
.
.
If you don't have the #iwillinshaAllah  journal, simply write down areas of your life that you can declutter. For those who have the journal, turn to page 41 ❤️
. .
Tune into the FB group “Productive Muslimaat” for a live session with @imanblogs at 6pm UTC on 11th September. .

projectskin_-1765467724462754889.info,"Hi everyone!! I managed to take a couple shots this morning. I have some thoughts to share on a few products that I have been testing out ✨
.
🌿Youth to the People Maqui + Açai  Prickly Pear Goji Face Oil* — super lightweight facial oil for hydrating and brightening! I love that this can be used day or night because it doesn’t feel heavy and it smells sweet, like candy 🍭 This product definitely works like a charm! My face looks so clear and bright ✨
🌿Monastery Clear Botanical Clearing Serum* — another light oil that I have been enjoying! It’s been keeping away those bumps under the skin. It also helps calm and heal blemishes a lot faster! I like to massage three drops into my skin and wait 5-10 minutes before applying the next steps of my routine.
🌿Korina Oily Acne-Prone Skin Serum* — I just recently started testing this out at night as a facial oil. It’s really hydrating but not overly greasy/heavy, which I really like. And this facial oil/serum packs a punch, it include tea tree essential oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, rosehip seed oil, vitamin E and more! I’ll have more thoughts on this later on 😊
🌿Iunik Propolis Vitamin Serum* — This serum is really lightweight and perfect to layer during the day or night. I like to use this to “prep” my skin just before applying other anti-aging/brightening/firming serums. I really love that this is so calming, soothing and hydrating. My skin is noticeably brighter and softer ☺️ this is definitely a new staple!
🌿It’s The Buff Customized Beauty Oil* — this is a really special facial oil formulated just for my oily acne-prone skin! I am loving the ingredients of my blend, it includes tea tree essence oil, jojoba oil, milk thistle seed, black cumin seed oil, vitamin E, licorice root extract and Brazilian rosewood essence oil. The size of this bottle is really generous, it contains 4oz/120mL of product. And my initials are monogrammed in the front of the label, which makes a great personalized finishing touch! More on this later 😊

.
I launched a business at 18 years old without a clue how it would do or what to do, and years later it’s successful and thriving, and also my absolute passion 👩🏻‍💻
.
I moved halfway across the country from Texas to Colorado and left all my college friends. Here, I found myself again, and also met my soulmate and best friend👫.
.
I invested tons of money and time into my education, not really knowing what I wanted to do, but now I’ve found my purpose and am pursuing a master’s🎓 .
.
It all works out when you’re brave💕
.
Life helps you, when you go for the things you want🔄
.
Trust the gut feeling you have and go for it, friends!✨
.
If it makes you nervous...good! You’re leveling up↗️
.
If it costs a you lot of money...good! Invest in yourself and it will come back tenfold💰
.
If you think you can’t do it...think again. I promise you you can✊🏼.

One step at a time, but be bold. Luck favors us ✨

Comment below!!!⬇️",1539957914,17960847283152944,"@leahpetersfitness I know you heard this in PM, but I’ll post it for others. The boldest action I took was leaving behind everything in Texas 2016 to go to rehab in Arizona. I was in the lowest point of my life, lost everything and was terrified to authentically trust God. I the move to California for a year to separate myself from a toxic life and relationships. A month before I moved back to Texas, I met my current boyfriend @dcbeddoe. He has shown me the grace and unconditional love I need to continue to be brave in my own walk. I moved back to Texas in 2017, to work as a medical nutritionist and later enrolled in pastoral school. This past month, my boyfriend move to Houston. We are making big plans in God’s kingdom as we start our own little life together out here. To reflect that all this started with one brave decision to get help, is the most humbling and beautiful experience a woman can ask for.",alli.keller281,1539961889,17872868905281413,@alli.keller281 your story is so beautiful and inspiring.
