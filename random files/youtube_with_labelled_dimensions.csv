Nightreign is a safe game. There's not a single innovation that game introduces. And battle royale machanic on top is just janky as hell - especially when playing with a team of randoms.

xpVkt2iba4k,Is Elden Ring Nightreign ACTUALLY Good?,Iron Pineapple,"26:45 I'm sorry, but it's a full 40$ game which already reuses insane amount of assets, so I'm pretty confident that expecting more than just 1 map and 1 game mode is completely reasonable. There's plenty of cheaper games, especially indie, that has way more content made specifically for the game and not mostly reused from previous titles. I think it's more than fair to expect more than that from a big, triple A developer like Fromsoft, especially since Elden Ring was such a massive hit.

EDIT/ ‚ÄãJust to clarify my point. Neither price nor reuse is bad in isolation. I don't even mind that it was a training project for new director. Demon Souls was basically one too. The point of reusing assets is so you can cut costs and spend more time on other stuff. I'm not saying they didn't make anything new for the game, but compere to reused content, it's not that much. If the game was cheaper, like 20/30$ then lack of new content and variety would feel less bad, but if they want to charge so much for it, they had to do more with it to justify it. So yes, having few different maps, even with reused assets and more game modes would go a long way to justify it.",@Nevri.,2025-05-29T00:42:32Z,"‚Äã@@brandolf6753You're just a fanboy who eats up anything they feed you, even if it's shit.",@ghhhjkuuikko,2025-05-29T03:21:50Z,conflict

Elden Ring was already severely outdated in a lot of different aspects like graphics, animations, movement, camerawork, physics, combat, stealth, enemy AI, quest design, dialogues, character progression, skills etc. And from what I've seen so far, Neightreign seems like it's even less impressive. It looks like a PS3-era game with its stiff animations, weapons clipping through your armor, outdated visual effects and weightless attacks that don't even connect with enemies properly. People at FromSoftware are pretty great at creating amazing worlds with immaculate atmosphere but they fall behind in everything else, and I think it's funny how everyone seems to be ignoring that.

xpVkt2iba4k,Is Elden Ring Nightreign ACTUALLY Good?,Iron Pineapple,"Tbh, as big a Fromsoft fanboy as I am, the beta convinced me not to buy this. I don't think I'm particularly bad at Souls games, but queueing with randoms I was only able to make it to day 2 once over about a dozen attempts. Apart from disconnects (which is totally understandable in a beta), my teammates were always either running far ahead or dilly dallying in the original drop area. Since I wasn't very familiar with the map or mechanics, I couldn't tell which one was doing the right thing, so I ended up just kind of running back and forth picking up loot and fighting basic mobs without any real goals in mind until the big day end fight killed us. I wanted to explore more, but the time limit made it basically impossible to both learn things AND beat bosses. It's interesting that you mention things becoming a bit boring when you know the optimal way to approach the map, because honestly, I think the process of learning this is kind of annoying too (at least with randos). You have no way of knowing whether your teammates are doing something clever or stupid until it either works, or doesn't. If I had a crew of people who wanted to coop with me over mic, I could imagine enjoying this.

The openness of Nightreign lets your focus be exploring and looting rather than getting stuck in the same fight over and over. If I don't want to finish a fight, I have dozens of other options. This makes leveling up and looting the main priority and then you spend your attention on the boss. That's an ideal game loop for me.

I see that BHVR has problem creating really good killers that arent ""chase"" ones. I mean that if a killer is not able to make longer distances in a shorter time then it will be low B tier tops.

OSCOQ6vnLwU,Closed captions on DVDs are getting left behind,Technology Connections,"FFmpeg maintainer here, and the details behind the caption decoding issues you're seeing in VLC are complex and horrific. They largely stem from how the EIA-608 caption format expects text to be laid out in a monospace grid onscreen, which isn't really how the text rendering stacks used for modern subtitling work (this is probably why changing the font caused problems on those Sony players); beyond that, the behavior can just end up pretty complex, and there's no convenient public-domain corpus of sample files for open-source software developers to test against. These kinds of issues also affect the Japanese (ARIB) and European (Teletext) formats to varying extents. These days, a lot of the focus ends up being on converting the text into modern Unicode text formats, styled using modern techniques, so direct rendering of the legacy formats hasn't had as much attention lately. If anybody reading this has some badly-behaved samples and wants to contribute, patches to improve the decoding and rendering behavior are definitely welcome, though!

One small correction: at 1:49 and 14:53, you say the players are ""decoding"" the captions, which isn't quite right. The captioning data embedded in the MPEG-2 bitstream (or H.264 in some more recent contexts) is the exact same format found on line 21 of the NTSC TV signal, so the player doesn't actually have to decode anything! It just takes the caption data from the current frame (or field) of video and sends it straight out on its analog output, completely unmodified.",@ridleycombs,2025-05-27T21:12:13Z,I was hoping you'd show up. üòª,@Ice_Karma,2025-05-28T02:05:30Z,power

There are even some conventions that are not carried out into subtitles and that makes me sad. The last time I saw some of theses conventions was on a Tom Scott video with multiple guest and it made the experience so much more enjoyable. Examples of things forgotten :
-Placing the subtitle under the person talking (as said in video). Most often it is quite clear, but making it crystal clear is always good.
-Writting in italic when the person talking is not on screen
-Changing the subtitle color depending on who talks (I'm not sure it is a CC thing, but in France it was used like that, but there is a video of you about this I think).

Anyway, at this time, youtube auto-subtitles in english is almost perfect and allows me to watch videos with no subtitles with no trouble.

Subtitles are a creature of the DVD disc architecture. Closed captioning is EIA508 or 608 stuff that's buried in the video stream, and that's what that symbol tells you that you have.

It is entirely possible, and actually likely, that source material that old was never subtitled, and that's why the subtitle button is not getting you anything.

Subtitling and captioning are aimed at different audiences which is one of the reasons why subtitles don't always match what's being said on the screen.

The things that Linus was mentioning about the touch things on the steering wheel activating when you were driving were very annoying.

DR4234R9spc,I put down a deposit on this car - 2025 Volkswagen ID Buzz,ShortCircuit,"Every time I hear Linus talk about cruise control, I end up questioning if I'm human. He always explains how it lets him pay more attention to the road‚Äîespecially in school zones‚Äîbecause he doesn't need to look at the speedometer. Meanwhile, I've never looked at my speedometer for more then a fraction of a second. Plus, if there are other cars on the road, than I know how fast to go based on their speed (and the distance between me and the car in front of me). However, even without other cars, I know how fast I'm going without looking at the speedometer. But, how is that possible? By feeling the small vibrations in the car, and knowing how they change as the vehicle speed changes. In other words, through experience of knowing the car. Of course, this does take time to develop, and the speedometer is handy for dialing that in. However, I would still know an approximate speed (within 5mph of accurate) during the very first time I'm in the car. How? By using my eyes and ears. Knowing how fast you are going by judging the time it takes your vehicle to travel along the road is an important skill. Plus, if you lower the driver's window by a small amount (an inch or so) then you'll hear the wind begin to change drastically as you hit 40mph. Of course, you don't want to go anywhere near that speed in a school zone. But, it's just another bit of important info that can let you know how fast you're going.

So, am I just an oddball? Am I just some super ""god tier"" level driver‚Äîusing inhuman skills to gauge speed without a speedometer? Does Linus really have no idea how fast he's going if he doesn't stare at the speedometer? Maybe he's never considered these things, or never been told about them? I just don't know anymore. Maybe I'm not human, or maybe my experience is common. Any info to help me know the answers would be greatly appreciated.
