Saying ""I propose that we should murder"" is a hazy middle ground that could be considered imminent incitement, but the abstract idea underneath -- that it would be a good thing if President Coolidge *were* murdered -- would be protected despite its repugnance.

Thanks for reading and responding, I've never come across someone going through the same thing (obviously I experienced it differently from my mum, I guess the fact it wasn't me on the receiving end of a wooden spoon or a fist gives me a certain level of objectivity about the whole thing).

My interpretation of the manifesto is that it was a humbly submitted, thoughtful alternative to current initiatives… initiatives that have failed to deliver desired goals. Damore said basically this: Google can’t change people, but they can change job descriptions. Instead of convincing women to pursue tech jobs they may not want, why not make those jobs more appealing to women in the first place? Never did he say women weren’t biologically suited to tech jobs.

Thanks Adam for being such an important and awesome part of my life and for giving me those memories with my dad, much love to you and yours, keep killing it.

Once automation is the norm and human labour is much less required the owners of automotons will have less need to support those who previously provided labour.

The reason why I say this is because my original comment that the person was replying to had to do with blaming all members of a race for something some of them did. It's ignorant to say that all white people at some point were involved in slavery of predominantly different races, especially recent enough to be relevant.

For example, even in an AP physics or calculus class you're learning mostly stuff from the 1800s and before, with a few 1950s concepts from einstein at the latest.

I'm working on an RPG system that is centered around the mechanics of dialogue, interaction, drama, and the development of rich interpersonal stories. This system is very heavily derived from systems of approaching plays as an actor. I see a huge parallel between roleplaying games and theatre - you are relating to people in the room on-the-fly as fictional people; you interact with your fellow players mainly through dialogue; you're co-creating a story together; RPG stories often follow similar dramatic structures.

Best way to do it, IMO, is to find teams middle of the pack or lower in saves, and offer a 2 for 1, where you give up a hitter or SP and a closer for an upgrade at hitter or SP. I just did that using Justin Wilson to upgrade from Bundy to CarMart at SP, so for me I was able to get about a 5-10 SP increase.	It all depends on your league, for some reason closers don't have much trade value in my league.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Game sense is also being able to identify what is really hurting your team and call for the appropriate counter - it's knowing when to use your support ult, and it's understanding what is giving you the advantage in a fight. If you really have 5 people running around like headless chickens, play Lucio.	It is my strong belief that game sense, not aim, will take you to plat.	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

6	Now you are just showing your ignorance of the context surrounding our constitutional history. The entire concept of our governance changed between 1791 and 1868 - prior to the civil war it was entirely about states supremacy over the federal government. From the direct appointment of Senators to forcing the Federal government to subsist solely on customs duties and the like. You are comparing apples to oranges - prior to the civil war, the states not the federal government were seen as the ultimate guarantor of individual liberties so it is the states rights and laws which were relevant, not federal laws, which were few and far between. After the civil war we gradually shifted to a model where it was the Federal government which was the ultimate guarantor of individual rights and Federal power which needed to be restrained as well.

Maybe the wrong side won in the civil war, we are too different to unite a continent in manifest destiny, perhaps our destiny was always going to rest in a disunited states, and Russia has just helped break us up like we broke up the USSR. Maybe our fates were always more aligned than we wanted to think, and liberals failed to help the Russians avoid their current fate, and karma dictates it is now our turn.

Also, the video length was a bit long for probably most people if you cant keep their interest, look at your audience retention to make sure people aren't dropping off so you can address that and adjust your formula!

6	Pretty good video overall i think you have a fairly engaging personality so keep that energy up! One thing I think you can improve on is your thumbnails, just use more contrasting text and less of it so that you can really see it pop in the search, this should help you get more clicks if you can make the thumbnails really engaging! Another thing is with the video being over 10 minutes in length you should definitely be keeping an eye on that audience retention, which is super important as that's what youtube looks at when it's trying to decide if it wants to push your videos!

She will get a check the following week for 500$ gross.

6	Technically I believe you would still be subject to tax on the entire picture similar to my Bitcoin example. Whether or not someone is reporting foreign currency exchange gains properly (or at all) is a different discussion. In your example using Euro, you would be taxed on the value in USD on the date you received the Euro. Then if you held on to the Euro and ended up exchanging it for USD at a gain later on, you would then pay tax on the gain. Again, maybe someone with more individual income tax experience could weigh in and let us know if we're at least on the right track here.

I left an abusive marriage (not his dad, but i was married after i had him), because i couldn't keep living with what was happening to him as he was trying to be supportive to me (he was around the same age as my little one now). it breaks my heart, because my 17 year old has seen so much... my anxiety, the crying in the middle of the night, me not wanting to be touched - but needing comfort, self destructive behavior, hiding and becoming reclusive when it all got to be too much to handle.

6	Thank you for not assuming bad faith on the part of my friend. She sat down with her kid to discuss it, and the kid vehemently expressed that she wanted her to do this if it was necessary. They are a family unit, and because this financial distress is temporary, they even talked about the mom working out a repayment plan in which she would deposit amounts into a savings account for the kid over the next year that would add up to what the FULL amount of the bonds actually equaled ($650); and then leave that account alone (hopefully, barring more crisis) and allow her access to it when she's 18. The whole point of accessing the funds in question is to avoid fines on non-payment of bills that would ultimately add up to a loss greater than what would be lost on the bonds in question. But it seems like everyone else who responded decided to read between lines that aren't there and instead of answering my actual question, just dish out admonishment over a situation that doesn't exist.

6	There are also some varying beliefs among believers about relationships/your past life when we get to heaven. These are some of the things I have been told before: -We will recognize those from our past life but will not be concerned with earthly relationships or care about anything beyond praising the Lord -We will not remember our pasts life, we will know everyone but no one will have particular significance -We will recognize those from our past life but our focus will be on praising the Lord, not our past life -Past relationships will no longer exists, we will be new beings, whole and pure, only desiring to bring praise to the Lord Personally I cannot see how God would so carefully design human emotion, love, and marriage only to have it done away with In heaven. I cannot imagine not recognizing, caring for, or being beyond overjoyed to be reunited with passed loved ones.

6	To begin, I agree with you that the reality we experience we know exists concretely. Whereas a possible god existing outside the universe is an 'if' in that we have no means of concretely proving this possible god does exist. I would go further though, and say that because this possible god cannot be concretely proved, its existence cannot be proved to not exist as well. But, we can make arguments that have concrete evidence that suggest a god may or may not exist. This then necessitates that a person must take a 'leap' into faith of either accepting or denying a possible god's existence.

Regarding the love and sin topic however, I think it should be noted that love itself is not a sin, but what love is directed toward can be.

Just because homosexual couples are genuine in their love for one another does not mean the object of their love isn't sin. But again, if you don't believe homosexuality is a sin, then there really is no point in having this conversation since my whole argument is based off the biblical assertion that it IS sin.

Feature freeze was a misstep, vulps have earned paradise ridicule for years due to being copy paste of taj which themselves are mechanically shallow. Drask were painfully slow to be added and rarely have more than one on the station, half the species have balance issues, the movement refactor has been a buggy mess. The naming rules degraded well below what any reasonable person could justify calling med-rp and staff defended those terrible rules which allowed movie and videogame characters to the death.

But in seriousness - If automation increases efficiency, there will only be as many cars on the road as are needed to meet demand. Maximum demand will require a maximum amount of cars.

If they admitted that being poor is often a generational problem that is incredibly hard to claw yourself out of, they'd be in trouble.

6	Here's my take, since I never see anyone bring up this point. I'm pro marijuana legalization btw, but not for drugs that are very addictive. Basically, the position I see libertarians take is that people should be free to do whatever drugs they want. But, from my perspective, drug addiction alters your mind and body to be dependent on the drug. Therefore, you no longer have the free will to stop (at least, not without great difficulty).

6	Hi /u/skellymancer , constructive criticism is the most impactful way to communicate. Can you highlight what I said that makes you think I'm complaining? Many people often remain neutral on a topic and have a discussion about it. I didn't mean to sound condescending in my post, so maybe I should have taken more time to type out the original question. I'm generally a happy person, and your concern for my well-being is heartwarming, thanks.

6	Hi Fanu, I definitely understand why you're bummed, and it's particularly tricky for me here since I personally am a fan of your work, both music and videos, and want you to feel welcome here. We do somewhat frequently discuss how we make things clearer and what the best thing would be to do to encourage good info, but not normalize having posts every time someone makes a video. I feel like we haven't really found anything perfect yet... we have enough people regularly trying to make and show videos that it is conceivable that the entire front page of the sub might be videos if they were allowed broadly. So we try to keep things sort of balanced, but I understand that it can be frustrating and I'd like to find something better if we could - I'm open to suggestions. I really appreciate that you'd be willing to consider a separate version to fit with our rules here.

Like you, I also really enjoy history and my university degree choice was between History and Psychology. I always had a stronger career preference for Psychology though.

Also, I'm not necessarily arguing for a single ruler but rather against voting rights for every class of people. The early American system of only landowners voting would be a preferable alternative in my view, one that does not violate any principle of liberalism.

From my experience, you're battling existing market leaders, trying to break into their customer base. The corporate infrastructure is loose (or in some cases, non-existent). I always view a sales territory as your own franchise, even more so at a start-up, depending on where the company stands in the VC process, its 100% sink or swim, and generally all success in your territory is on you.

6	I can tell you from experience that it’s because you get MORE of the junk food for the same price as the healthy food. In our capitalist country, getting the most for your money is deeply ingrained in the public mindset. They don’t call the combos at fast food restaurants massive meals, they call them “value meals.” People like to feel smart. They like to feel like they’re getting the most for their money, especially when money is scarcer in their life. If somebody has $5 to spend on a snack to pack with their kids lunches for the week, are they gonna get 3 apples which will only serve one kid and not even for the whole week, or are they gonna buy the box of chips ahoy that will “round out” both kids lunch boxes for the week AND leave some behind for mom to munch on when she’s on break at work?

6	I don't think it's an either or thing - depending on who you are and what objectives you have, as well as time frame, both sides can be correct in believing whether market timing is possible or not possible. Long term investors who believe in a stock or a sector really don't care or need to believe in market timing, and prefer to just put money in over time, whereas traders who look for bargains or trade on momentum in a shorter outlook see market timing and momentum shift as a more tangible, useful thing. In the end, does it really matter much if you timed the markets correctly and put all your money at SPX 666 bottom and rode it up to this point, or if you're a long term investor and steadily bought dips all the way to the bottom and averaged about to a higher price and rode it all the way to now? Former may have more risk and reward, and he/she's fine with that, whereas the latter has less risk and reward, and they're fine with that as well.

So it'll take a bit longer to get used to IDing in a Rift than it does on a monitor but that's a small trade off. In my opinion, everything else is easier thanks to the depth perception you get.

In my experience doctors don't listen to their patience and just give you the run around.

Thanks for enlightening me on this, but I still believe people should continue being the gender they were born with even if men feel feminine or female feel masculine. You can still express your character under the two basic genders we already have, because people are different. For example, I had a friend who was extremely feminine, the way he talks, the way he walks, they people he hangs out with. I assumed that was just his character, but in my senior year in high school he came out the closet and professed that he was in fact gay.

6	I obviously can't really comment on the play party that you'll be going to this weekend, but I can say that every kink event I've ever been to has been 100% inclusive and welcoming of all orientations, genders, configurations, body types, etc. Kinksters are still marginalized to an extent, so we generally want to make our events safe for people to express their authentic selves. The norm for kinky events in my experience is that you negotiate everything before doing anything. You can disclose your asexual status while negotiating if you want, but you don't need to give a reason for excluding sexual contact if you don't want to. In my case, I don't engage in sexual contact with play partners because I'm monogamous with my wife in that sense.

6	I once asked a very renowned cosmologist about this. I asked specifically what would be the same and what would be different between universes. The theories he was aware of considered that the truly most fundamental fields and elementary interactions of the Standard Model would be the same, but there are a number of effective interaction strengths and masses which come about from spontaneous symmetry breaking which would be different among universes and this has a major effect on the eventual observable dynamics and phenomenology of cosmological evolution and generation of matter and structure. This was the clearest and most sensible answer I've ever heard on this very confusing subject and sounds like physics which can be worked on, and not mystical mumbo jumbo. Mind you---this is from my memory at a social event with beer so I won't vouch for its accuracy.

6	I think a lot of posters here are eager to correct misconceptions about breeders and purebred dogs, and so can create this environment that seems more pro-breeder than rescue. But in my short-ish experience on this sub they're both equally supported depending on what you want. For instance if you have kids or very specific energy/temperament needs then you're often safer going through a reputable breeder because their lines are health/temperament tested. If you don't have time for a puppy or want an adult dog without specific breed requirements, shelters are recommended.

6	I think the democracy you are putting forward and a more successful form of democracy are two different concepts though. This first lies on the presumption of the American system being a true democracy which I would say is not true because economic representation is disproportionately favored to the rich; it is more of an oligarchy with features which exist simply to keep the labor class from revolting - hence why other logical advancements such as full automation haven't been made yet. I like the approach here with rights, yet the analogy you make here is a little rough for me. It would be wrong to shoot someone simply over their opinion (unless they're a fascist - never wrong to kill a Nazi; Scalise treads dangerous water with his inability to recall whether or not he's been to a White Supremacist rally or not).

However, I think that if we approach _many_ topics pragmatically we will recognize that people learn and grow based on an assumption that _circumstance_ drives political view.

How we draw this distinction will depend upon your views on morality and political-legal justice. As a Kantian, I have rather particular and austere views on the subject which leads me to draw a very sharp distinction between violence committed by states (which can be further divided and analyzed - sometimes just, sometimes unjust) and violence committed by citizens (which, except for extremely limited circumstances of self-defense, is never justified). With a Mill flair, you will probably disagree. Still, there seems to be an enormous intuitive difference from the point of view of common sense between violence that is subject to rules, that is limited in its objective, regulated in its form, narrowly directed, and reviewed by institutions, and violence that is random, open-ended, extreme, broadly applied, and justified only privately.

6	No disrespect, but I have conflict with a lot of what you stated. First, I can 100% guarantee you we are mutually comfortable moving forward with each other sexually. Second, the point of us using contraception isn't so we can act irresponsible and be upset if it does fail, it's to, as it says on the tin, decrease the risk of unwanted pregnancy. Third and fourth, your friends' experiences regarding PP and contraception are not representative of what years of research shows, which is that contraception, especially the IUD, vastly, vastly lowers pregnancy risk (when used correctly) compared to using nothing at all. My own friends and family in 3 different states have had nothing but good experiences with Planned Parenthood, so please do not assume that we are dooming ourselves to some corrupt organization that's using us to make a profit.

6	Oh hey secessionist propagandist The vote was rigged (urns were not sealed and filled with votes before the voting took place), you could vote multiple times (with 72 municipalities recording over 100% of their population voting yes), there were no international poll watchers (UN plain refused to send them) and in any case the only ones to organize it, vote, and count the votes were all separatists. Pretending it was legitimate is akin to me voting in my own house and imposing upon you the results of whatever vote I had while calling your resistance fascism. Doesn't help that according to our own Catalan laws we needed a majority to call the ellection we did not have, and according to the constitution (Who Catalans wrote in its majority and approved by one of the biggest margins of the land, 90% voting yes with over 70% turnout) every piece of Spanish land is of every Spaniard and by doing that referendum exclusively in Catalonia technically you take away 30m+ Spaniards of their right to vote (the only argument for them not to vote I have ever heard is that they wouldn't vote what secessionists want them to vote). The police, ordered by a judge stationed in Barcelona (not by our government) had to stop the referendum - The people trying to stop the police are in the wrong here and out of the probably tens of thousands that did try to stop the police carrying their duties, 4 went to the hospital whereas 39 police needed medical attention.

If you're not with the car, like when it's with a mechanic, and you record a conversation then no party would be consenting; that's presuming that no party is aware of the dashcam or that it's recording. This has, from my understanding, been a contentious issue in Texas, specifically regarding dashcams, because of the strange language of the law.

While I can't comment on the merits of your experience - e.g. if it was right or wrong for you to placed in an ED program - I don't think that's the take-away here.

6	Translation/NRSV|Comment| :--|:--|:-- (1 Thessalonians 1) Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.| 2 We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers, constantly| 3 remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.| 4 For we know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you,| 5 because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake.| 6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,| 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.| 8 For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has become known, so that we have no need to speak about it.| 9 For the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,| 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.| Translation/NRSV|Comment| :--|:--|:-- (1 Thessalonians 2) You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you was not in vain,| 2 but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition.| 3 For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery,| 4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, even so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please God who tests our hearts.| 5 As you know and as God is our witness, we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed;| 6 nor did we seek praise from mortals, whether from you or from others,| 7 though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children. 8 So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you have become very dear to us.| 9 You remember our labor and toil, brothers and sisters; we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.| 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how pure, upright, and blameless our conduct was toward you believers.| 11 As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children,| 12 urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.| 13 We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God's word, which is also at work in you believers.| 14 For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews,| 15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out; they displease God and oppose everyone| 16 by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins; but God's wrath has overtaken them at last.| 17 As for us, brothers and sisters, when, for a short time, we were made orphans by being separated from you--in person, not in heart--we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face.| 18 For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, wanted to again and again--but Satan blocked our way.| 19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?| 20 Yes, you are our glory and joy!| Translation/NRSV|Comment| :--|:--|:-- (1 Thessalonians 3) Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we decided to be left alone in Athens;| 2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker for God in proclaiming the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith,| 3 so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions.

6	for a long time, our phone plans were built off of a subsidy model, and we are still transitioning away from that. you would pay $200 for the latest iphone, but you'd be locked in with your carrier for 2 years (and because of this model, the prices would be higher because the phone company has to recoup their investment on picking up $400+ of the cost of your phone). another factor that kind of screws you over is that our phone plans are HEAVILY geared towards family plans. if you have a single line, you are going to be heavily overpaying compared to the per line cost if you were on a family plan with 4 lines (which seems to be the sweet spot for these types of plans).	another factor that kind of screws you over is that our phone plans are HEAVILY geared towards family plans.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0

If a portion of your aim is to own shares in company x, that could change massively month to month.

6	you see those little blue letters at the bottom of my comment? those are a little thing called sources. you see, when i make claims i like to use sources to back them up so people don't just assume i'm talking out my arse. i also don't resort to petty insults and slurs, you should try it some time. the electoral college very clearly favoured white slave holding states, and still to this day favours the political descendent of the anti-abolitionist.	i also don't resort to petty insults and slurs, you should try it some time.	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6	you should cut away a square section to make the patch clean and this square section should extend to either side far enough to expose the rafter. this is to give you something to screw into. alternatively, you can straddle the a couple furring strips to the top side of a smaller hole and attach them directly to the ceiling with drywall screws or framing nails, however, this still means you have to cover the screw/nail heads. anyway, cut a patch piece of drywall (of equal thickness to the existing) to fit the hole and screw it in place. tape the seams with your choice of the numerous types of joint tape, i prefer the fiberglass mesh.	tape the seams with your choice of the numerous types of joint tape, i prefer the fiberglass mesh.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	2

6	your boyfriend not sticking up for you when someone is verbally abusive to you is a huge red flag and would be a deal breaker for me. he is more worried about not offending his friend than he is about someone treating you badly. i think it's reasonable to question your relationship and willingness to commit to a year-long lease. can just one of you be on the lease and find a place that you could afford solo? then if you break up you aren't legally bound to the same residence.	i think it's reasonable to question your relationship and willingness to commit to a year-long lease.	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

6	“Cut the grind in half” they didn’t cut anything in half. It was easy as hell from the get go. And you never brought up “valid points” that are working against our community. You bitched about a friend buying in game shit, you bitched about people who have addictions playing it and being unable to control themselves, and then you said some stupid shit that went against your own argument when I used the analogy of blaming the drunk, and not the manufacturer. If you don’t piss your pants at Guinness every time someone drunk drives on their product, you shouldn’t be whining to EA because gambling addicts will struggle with their game.
