X7J3-4mC6ws,"My K 1200 LT, with this basic design Engine, if I parked it on the side stand, and returned shortly after parking. When I started the machine, it poured smoke out the exhaust like a Kawasaki 500 / 2 stroke tripple..
  I complained to my dealer about it. He said that‚Äôs normal.
  If the clutch slave cylinder leaked onto the clutch. which was not uncommon, the slave cylinder, and the clutch, had to be replaced‚Ä¶ an acquaintance of mine was a mechanic at a BMW motorcycle shop‚Ä¶ that is when I found this out and I was very interested because at the time I had The same machine that was being operated on on the mechanics bench.
  it was 2010. he had the rear wheel, the bodywork, the trunk, the seats, the rear frame section, the swingarm, the transmission, and who knows what else removed when he called me over to take a look at what my bike looks like in the work required to change the clutch.. I asked him what a job like this costs..
  he paused as he looked at me for my reaction. He said approximately $4500, Plus parts,plus disposal fee, Plus shop materials, Plus tax.
that was in 2010, 2010 prices‚Ä¶
  I have had dozens of bikes over the past five decades. Venture‚Äôs, goldwings, Sport bikes, commuters, dual sports, dirt bikes, trails bikes, road racing machines, lots of makes.. gas gas, beta,fantic, moto guzzi, Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, Bridgestone, and one BMW..
  108 so far.
  The most disappointing motorcycle I ever owned was the BMW K 1200 LT. It had the second best seat I ever owned, the motor made adequate power, nice widely spaced transmission complemented the broad torque power band of the engine. I loved the heated seat and grips.. it had a great headlight. The cruise control was among the best i have had.. my wife loved the heated seat and heated back rest. reverse came in handy.
BUT:::
 I was looking for a remote campground where my friends were camping‚Ä¶ I got a little lost, and I had to turn around. I ended up going down a fairly steep paved road covered with fly ash/cinders. no problem, I‚Äôve had decades of off-road riding experience on slippery surfaces‚Ä¶I tapped the brakes going down that fairly steep hill covered with cinders, and I wasn‚Äôt ready for this, I had no brakes at all..Nothing. I pumped the brakes, nothing front or rear. That was my first experience with ABS brakes on slippery surface‚Äôs..The motorcycle ABS computer detected slippage, so it shut the brakes off. I suppose ABS really stands for, all braking stops.. so there I was going down the slope of a road in the middle of nowhere with no brakes on a 900 pound motorcycle. There was a 90¬∞ turn coming up at the bottom of this hill. Luckily, about 20 feet off the road there was an 8 foot high cyclone fence around some type of auto salvage business.. I went straight off the road through the grass and into the fence with my front wheel. The only damage I had was a broken front fender..
  after I replaced the fender, I decided change the brake fluid and the clutch fluid. I used to be a motorcycle mechanic and several different dealerships, no big deal to change brake fluid and clutch fluid.. actually it is a big deal with a BMW. I did research on the Internet, and people on blogs said, don‚Äôt even attempt to try this job yourself because, if you get air in the system, the system will detect that and shut down completely front and back wheel.. he will then have to trailer the bike to the dealer to have the dealer plug the machine into its diagnostics terminal to reset the ABS after they bleed the brakes.
  I didn‚Äôt believe that, so I bought the plastic vessel for holding more brake fluid that attaches to the reservoir for the brake fluid. Because the brakes on this machine were electric, hydraulic. The key must be on to activate the servo pump, to pass the brake fluid through the system‚Ä¶ The reservoir is so tiny and the servo will suck that brake fluid out of there so fast, that you will get air in the system if you‚Äôre not careful. And when that happens, you are screwed.
  I called the dealer and asked how much it would be to have my brake fluid changed. Three month wait, $750, plus parts, plus shop materials, plus disposal fee, plus tax
   I did the job myself, taking my good old time being very careful with brake fluid and being careful not to get air in the system. It took me less than an hour..
   while I was doing research online about maintenance since this was my very first BMW. I read everything. While doing research I found that it is not uncommon to have the final drive bearings fail.. I read the two guys that were entered in the iron butt , actually carried a spare final drive housing with them.. that‚Äôs how much they knew.
   aside from all the nice things I liked about the bike, I thought the windshield was unacceptably distorted for $22,000 motorcycle. The self alarming security system was a pain. It would reset even after a five minute gas stop. I had to dig in my pockets to pull out the key fob to push the button to unlock the security system to start the bike to continue on my trip every time I got gas..
  that BMW had a weird front end. You could not compress the suspension by pressing on it, by pumping the bars, you could not get that front end to go down, but, the front wheel would only come up when you hit irregularities in the road.The result of that system is, when you are in a parking lot doing tight turns at low speeds, And you tap the brakes at low speed, that kinetic energy of you moving normally would go into the front fork springs and be dissipated. But the front end on that machine does not compress from braking.. that energy has nowhere to go, and if you have the handlebars turned slightly, you better have strong legs and they better be long because you are going to be struggling to hold that machine up. I never dropped any of my three Yamaha ventures that I had close to 290 miles combined on, I never dropped my GL 1800 Goldwing, but I drop that BMW K 1200 LT two times in slow speed parking lot situation‚Äôs.
  I mentioned that to a group of 3K 1200 owners I bumped into at a motorcycle bike night. They all three started laughing and one of them walked me over to his bike. His mirrors were scarred, he said everybody drops them..look at both of my mirrors. he said the reason my mirror isn‚Äôt replaced is because they cost $490 each‚Ä¶The other 2 K1200 owners also agreed, they had dropped their machines also. That is one weird front end, and I now realize why no other manufacturer in the world has attempted to copy it‚Ä¶
   The rear brakes on my BMW made a horrible metal on metal grinding noise so loud, that people would turn to see what that noise was as I would be slowing down at stop signs and red lights. I mentioned this to my dealer. He said we can fix that. I say well what do you have to do. He said, and aftermarket rotor and pads. I asked how much is that. he said approximately $800, plus short material, plus disposal fee, plus tax
   I started to develop a different braking reflex.. it was not automatic, I had to think about it every time. And what I was doing differently was, I was not using the rear brake in slow speed areas, leaving my right hand free to finesse the throttle in conjunction with my left hand working the clutch at slow speeds. I had to start breaking with my right hand in these slow speeds, not touch the back brake, because of that embarrassing grinding noise‚Ä¶It was an awkward distraction because I would revert back to my normal braking habits, resulting in that screeching grinding noise.
 I had finally had enough. I thought they were the best machines , Because the most seasoned group of riders were the BMW riders,At least the ones that rode the air cooled twins were‚Ä¶
  I sold that machine, I had enough.. I was disappointed. I went out and bought a Moto Guzzi Norge, with heated grips, electric windshield, a pretty good seat, and ABS brakes that could be turned off at the push of a button, for those times when you get caught on a steep gravel covered road, or on wet grass on a slope, or get caught in the snow which I have had happened to me on several occasions. Luckily I was on machines that did not have ABS brakes so I made it home with brakes‚Ä¶ and Norge was my fourth guzzi.. I rode that machine for 14 years, no problem, 30 minute valve adjustment, I didn‚Äôt even have to remove the gas tank.. wonderful loping torquey motor‚Ä¶
  I thought I was buying the most wonderful most advanced machine capable of traveling for hundreds of thousands of miles when I bought that BMW. That was the most disappointing motorcycle of my life. I will never buy another BMW. ‚Ä¶You have to marry the dealer‚Ä¶
  before I get a lot of BMW owners pissed off at me. I sold my Norge a couple years ago and bought a Honda GL 1800 Goldwing. That was the first perfect motorcycle of my life. It was perfect. It did everything perfectly. it‚Äôs the smoothest thing in the universe, the ride will put you to sleep, it‚Äôs also perfectly boring. It had about as much personality as my toaster. So I sold it, and went back to a non-ABS motorcycle. A 2008 Yamaha venture. That is my touring machine at the moment.. it ain‚Äôt perfect, it is very comfortable and much roomier than the gold wing, I can get to the clutch, the slave cylinder, the water pump, the stator in minutes, they are not buried under plastic panels. They‚Äôre right there on the sides of the engine. I could practically service them with the tool kit if necessary. It does everything the Goldwing does except reverse..And, it gets 48 miles to the gallon so far. My Goldwing only got 33 miles to the gallon.. I had my first Yamaha venture for 16 years 138,000 trouble-free miles. I like  them.. that‚Äôs a great fairing. If it gets too hot to ride behind that fairing, I‚Äôll ride one of my other bikes that don‚Äôt have fairings..
One last note. Are used to be for BMW motorcycle dealers within 45 minutes of my home. Now there aren‚Äôt any. ..","I think your dealer pricing is highway robbery. My K1100 was costing less to run than equivalent Honda and Kawasaki, never found out about Yamaha, but probably the same. I have had the clutch replaced with original parts for approximately $2000 Australian dollars. A complete tear down of the K100 was $1700 to replace all gearbox seals and the input shaft, at about 200,000 Km. Anyone familiar with the K100 knows this is inevitable on K100 bikes. My K100&K1100 both made 300,000 Km before selling.

MsZL-__HHW0,"Now I know how to remove the dispenser drawer but I would like to know why the fabric softener section will not dispense the correct amount of softener and fills up with water that is still there when the cycle is over. Every time I do a wash even if I leave the softener out, there's always quite a lot of water left in the drawer which I have to siphon out. This machine is only 3 weeks old and has been like this from the very first wash.","@Save TheUmmah I had the Hotpoint engineer out to have a look at the machine and he did all the tests with his fancy gadget and said it was because the water pressure was too low and nothing was wrong with the machine. He swapped the infill hose from cold to hot and pointed out that it was filling properly now but we had to be aware that the hot fill hose may be little to harsh for delicates etc. We couldn't understand why the cold fill hose had always been alright with our previous washing machine and not with this new Hotpoint. To cut a long story short, we put the hose back onto the cold fill tap as it should have been all along albeit taking longer to fill, but discovered that that the softener dispenser still didn't empty properly. After trial and error we discovered that after the end of whatever cycle you choose and you check if the softener has gone, then its worked, but I have found a way to make this work. After the cycle has finished and the softener is still in the drawer, just turn your dial to spin and pump out. This only takes 10 minutes but at least you get the softener into your laundry. This shouldn't have happened right from the beginning but trying to get the engineer to understand that was a almost impossible. I was ready to get Hotpoint to collect the machine and I would go back to my beloved Boche make. I do hope this helps you to understand this problem with Hotpoint.",2020-06-08T10:02:49Z,2020-10-07T12:45:46Z,How to remove your washing machine dispenser drawer  | by Hotpoint,26,Hotpoint Customer Service UK,26,Howto & Style

having the same mechanical fuel pump as your splendid Frog eyes Sprite. I have your same problem: when the engine and the exhaust become hot, the fuel pump does not work and the car breaks down. I then intend to proceed with the installation of the electric pump you suggest. Before doing this  I would like to leave the original pump on trying to isolate as far as possible the pump from the heat, do you think it could be a viable solution? In any case, does the Huco electric pump you have installed have number 133010 and 12 volt?

That is the growth or earnings of a Roth.  You pay taxes on a Roth at the time of conversion or income.  Is the treaty in place between the U.S. and France favorable to a Roth conversion?  Perhaps.  Anyway... there are a few things I heard here that I would correct...",An IRA is tax-deferred so you don't pay taxes on money going in but you do when it comes out in the form of a distribution or conversion. A Roth IRA takes money that you already paid taxes on but all future distributions of the gains are tax-free in the US.

0wX6-lLidag,"So where do you get the Shellawax? Can you just pick it up at say, Woodcraft? Also, what pen kit did you use for that one?","Hello,
  I'll do my best to answer your questions. 

  The pen kit I was using was the Classic from Penn State: www.pennstateind.com. 

  I also purchased the Shella Wax from Pen State. I don't have a local Woodcraft so I'm not sure if they carry the Shella Wax brand but they do carry other shellac based pen finishes. 

  I made that video several years ago and quite a bit has changed in my refinishing method. 

  I use punches to remove the nib, transmission, and ferrel from the pen. For the classic, I would still have to tape the trim ring because it's glued on but most other pens can be completely disassembled.
 
  Once disassembled, you can use your normal pen mandrel and bushings to refinish the pen. 

  The original finish on that pen was Crystal Coat and Hut wax. If the pen had C/A on it, it would require sanding to remove that finish as opposed to just using the EEE Polish.
 
  I also no longer use Shella Wax for finishing pens. I love SW for items that are not handled often, like ornaments, because it looks terrific. Pens are handled daily and I found SW just didn't hold up. I now use C/A glue to finish all my wood and antler pens.
 
  I have several videos that explain the C/A technique I use if your interested. The brand of C/A I prefer is Insta-Bond and I get it from Packard Woodworks: www.packardwoodworks.com. 

  I sincerely hope this information helps.

¬† This idea came out of necessity, some of the pens I made earlier in my turning days weren't holding their finish as well as I would have liked. I have even moved past Shella Wax and now use CA glue because once you get use to using it, It gives a great finish that is almost indestructible.

0WX6-qOYFvY,I think the X-Wing Starfighter is one of the best sets ever made by LEGO (cuz of its appearance in Star Wars in the Rebel Invasion on the Death Star) and it truly deserves a place in this top ten (instead of the Clone Turbo Tank which is in my opinion the worst of the 10 shown on your list). But its still a nice preview tho! ,i have the 2006 (?) xwing and it is a good set. definitely would be in my top 20. thanks for watching,2014-06-29T00:46:15Z,2014-06-29T06:38:40Z,My Top 10 Lego Star Wars Sets,24,darthphoenix619,24,Entertainment

Fg7U-BhiZGE,"Being Italian, I‚Äôm noticing all of the comments relating to alcoholism and being sober as an accomplishment come mostly from Americans and British people. We don‚Äôt have such a thing in Italy. I grew up next to Montalcino where we produce wine. Wine is considered a big part of our culture, we drink a glass with our meals, and no one suffer from addiction: I think it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt drink wine as a mean to get drunk. Now I live in Saudi Arabia where alcohol is forbidden. I don‚Äôt feel or miss the alcohol, but when I‚Äôm out of this country of course I order my good glass of wine. I go back to Saudi where no alcohol is sold and I‚Äôm ok. I truly cannot understand how you can get addicted to the point of ruining your life, everything done in moderation is fine. As for the research that alcohol increases the risk of cancer: yeah, so it is eating too much meat, so it is living in a polluted city, so it is if eating too much processed food, so it is abusing of medications and so on. The key is moderation! But also, don‚Äôt forget to LIVE. We could die from a bunch of different reasons, example: driving a car increases the risk of getting involved in a car accident. Should we stop to drive? My point is: drink and enjoy that glass of wine, life is short.

Alcohol is well known to burn up b1 and a lot of the body wide damage comes from that. B1 is not present much in many foods so you won't get good levels back fast via normal eating.  B1 is also a vitamin that it's nearly impossible to overdose on so it's pretty safe. Take daily for at least a few months to help recover from past damage, if there is a lot of damage, years are recommended, it is possibly to slowly regain some of the lost brain function by doing this.  If you should fall off the alcohol wagon (or for anyone still drinking), be sure to take b1 daily that entire time to protect your brain function. Try to take the b1 pill when there is no alcohol going down with it if possible for better absorption.

This is why Paul says in ephesians ""for by grace you have been saved (past tense) through faith and NOT OF YOURSELVES, it is a gift of God. Not of works so that no one may boast."" This is also why in John's gospel (the one actually written to save the lost; see john 21:30-31) he gives the sole criteria to be saved which is to believe. This is also why Paul tells the church of Rome the difference between grace and works in Romans 11:7 ""For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.""And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."" Believe the gospel performed on your behalf (the death, burial and resurrection) and recieve eternal life today. Jesus died to pay the penalty for your sin which is death. If he already payed your debt then there is only one place to go.","@53n7w9¬† I said please because I have no other desire than to see you get saved, friend. I guess my confusion lies in why an object is needed when there isn't one present in the Bible? Everyone just prays to God directly. Also, why repeat ""hail mary"" continuously? Does that do something extra? I understand the angel said that to Mary, but it was just a greeting, and he said it once. I mean, why pray to Mary at all? The Bible never commands such a thing, and it doesn't really even make sense in concept. Why would I pray to an objectively lesser being who is limited in capability if I have the option to pray the the almighty God who can do anything.",2023-11-13T17:40:40Z,2024-01-03T19:36:30Z,Pray with Us: The Holy Rosary,24,Ascension Presents,24,Entertainment

JgtJ-sFzWww,"please read and ponder. God bless

Matthew 6:7 KJV
[7] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

1. Repeating the same words over and over like a magic incantation does not guarantee that God will hear your prayer any better. It‚Äôs not wrong to come to God many times with the same requests‚ÄîJesus encourages persistent prayer (Luke 18:1-8). But he condemns the shallow repetition of words that are not offered with a sincere heart. We can never pray too much if our prayers are honest and sincere. When you pray, keep your heart and mind actively engaged. Make sure you mean what you say.

2. ‚ÄúTo repeat a form of prayer a very large number of times has always seemed to the ignorantly religious to be a praiseworthy thing; but assuredly it is not so. It is a mere exercise of memory, and of the organs of noise-making: and it is absurd to imagine that such a parrot‚Äù

‚Äúexercise can be pleasing to the living God. The Mahometans and Papists keep to this heathenish custom; but we must not imitate them.

God does not need us to pray for his information, for he ‚Äúknoweth what things ye have need of‚Äù; nor to repeat the prayer over and over for his persuasion, for as our Father he is willing to bless us. 
Therefore let us not be superstitious and dream that there is virtue in ‚Äúmuch speaking.‚Äù In the multitude of words, even in prayer, there wanteth not sin. Repetitions we may have, but not ‚Äúvain repetitions.‚Äù 
Counting beads, and reckoning the time occupied in devotion, are both idle things. Christians‚Äô prayers are measured by weight, and not by length. 
Many of the most prevailing prayers have been as short as they were strong.","We are sorry you have been led down the road of hating Christ's Church, but are sure it was not wittingly. May God bless you and your family in every way possible. I don't know what will happen at the Last Judgement but rest assured I am praying for you as much as for myself. We love you and respect you.

JgtJ-sFzWww,"Mathew 6:6-7
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking.","Matthew 6:7 And in praying do not heap up empty phrases (‚Äúvain repetitions‚Äù in KJV) as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.

Notice the context? Jesus said ‚Äúdo not heap up ‚Äòempty phrases‚Äô (Gr. ‚Äì battalagesete,  which means to stammer, babble, prate, or to repeat the same things over and over mindlessly) as the Gentiles do‚Ä¶‚Äù We have to remember that the main idea of prayer and sacrifice among the pagans was to appease the gods so that you could go on with your own life. You had to be careful to ‚Äútake care of‚Äù all of the gods by mentioning them, and saying all the right words, lest you bring a curse upon yourself.
And remember as well, the gods themselves were immoral at times! They were selfish, cruel, vengeful etc. The pagans would say their incantations, offer their sacrifice, but there was no real connection between the moral life and the prayer. Jesus is saying that this will not cut it in the New Covenant Kingdom of God! One must pray from a heart of repentance and submission to God‚Äôs will. But does Jesus mean to exclude the possibility of devotions like the Rosary or the Divine Mercy Chaplet which repeat prayers? No, he does not. This becomes evident when, in the very next verses of Matthew 6, Jesus says:

Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

Jesus gave us a prayer to recite! But notice the emphasis on living the words of the prayer! This is a prayer to be recited, but they are neither ‚Äúempty phrases‚Äù nor ‚Äúvain repetitions.‚Äù

Consider the prayers of the angels in Revelation 4:8:

And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù

These ‚Äúfour living creatures‚Äù refer back to four angels, or ‚ÄúSeraphim,‚Äù that Isaiah saw as revealed in Is. 6:1-3 about 800 years earlier, and guess what they were praying?

In the year that King Uzzi‚Äôah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.‚Äù

Someone needs to inform these angels about ‚Äúvain repetition!‚Äù According to many of our Protestant friends, especially Fundamentalists, they need to knock it off and pray something different! They‚Äôd been praying like that for ca. 800 years!",2022-05-15T23:10:15Z,2022-09-13T05:49:40Z,Pray with Us: The Holy Rosary,24,Ascension Presents,24,Entertainment

JgtJ-sFzWww,"I personally dont understand the Rosary. I find it very repetitive. I prefer to talk to God direct and just be real with him. God does not need us to use lofty language, restate the facts or use long winded prayers or mantras. If it helps you to focus your heart and mind on God and what he has done for you fair enough, but if you do it out of duty and it distracts from communicating with God. Just stop and pray direct to God. As his children we can come straight to him without barriers. We dont need to pray through Mary, Saints or Priests. When our Lord Jesus died the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom as a symbol from God that we can all approach him not just through Holy Jewish high priests. Jesus himself taught us that. ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."" All God's children regardless of age, wisdom, biblical knowledge etc.. can approach our heavenly Father in prayer direct.

üôèüèªThank you Lord Jesus for dying for my sins and breaking the barrier that seperated me from our Heavenly Father. No longer am I constrained but have been set free from the bondage of sin. Thank you God for ordinary men and women of faith past and present who have prepared the way that others might know and be in communion with you. Lord God I ask that you bring comfort and healing to the sick and needy today. Help support those who care and minister to them. I also lift up those who are dying. May they place their trust in you if they have not already done so and give them comfort and assurance that they will soon be in your heavenly arms in heaven where there will be no more sin, no more sickness and no more death. Comfort those who mourn and give them peace that their loved ones placed their trust in you! O holy Spirit be with us in all we say and do this day. Help us to be more Christ like in action and deed. Please give us opportunities to share the Gospel. We may not have the words but we ask that the Holy Spirit speaks though us to reach those lost and needing a Saviour this day. I ask all this in Jesus Holy name. Amenüôèüèª",Why are you typing a comment as a prayer here when you can pray directly to Jesus?

JgtJ-sFzWww,"Almighty God, O love the Rosary.  I believe it honours the blessed virgin Mary and that it glorifies You. I also believe that all Marian apparitions were really the Virgin sent by You as Your messenger to the world.
However, if these beliefs are not what they seem and not what the church says they are, and the Rosary doesn't glorify You and it wasn't Mary who appeared and continues to appear to Catholics all over the world, then I pray that you stop me from wanting to pray this way and enable me to understand why such prayers are wrong and I will meditate on the life of Christ by simply reading about it in the gospel accounts.

JgtJ-sFzWww,"I am a Protestant, raised Protestant. I have been interested and attracted to the rosary at different times in my life. Once I even re-wrote the rosary prayers, not to in any way disrespect the original words, but to make them more powerful for me. I found the rosary prayers online last night and went through them. I should get  a book and booklet in the mail from Amazon tomorrow on Christmas Eve. For whatever reasons, I feel a strong need to make the rosary a part of my spiritual walk (and work) right now. Although I feel a certain disdain for ritual or even just over-emphasizing the external aspects of our Bible stories (without deeply looking at the more internal ""symbolic"" ""allegorical"" or ""metaphysical"" aspects), I can't tell you enough how much I appreciated praying the rosary with you. For the first time in my life, during decade 3, I started to have a vision of the Virgin Mary and felt flooded with a sense of peace. I know that the purpose of prayer is not necessarily to seek certain ""feelings"" or ""sensations,"" as you said, Fr. Mark-Mary in a prior video, but to develop more of a ""relationship"" or a sense of deeper ""contemplation.""  I desire very much to go deeper now. As much as I have major issues with the Catholic Church in general and I could never ever in good conscience ever convert to Catholicism, I am grateful that the Catholic Church still exists and that these beautiful prayers, like the rosary, can be offered to the world. Thank you so much! I look forward to deepening my relationship with God, Mary, Christ, the archangels, angels and saints!

Remember, our omnipotent God already knows what you need and what you're feeling even befote you open your mouth. He knows whats inside our hearts, so there's really no use if we use the prayer in this video or the rosary. He knows whether youre lying or telling the truth.

Tell God what's really in your minds and in your hearts. Remember to also include your gratefuness and thanks for all the blessings you receive, like being able to wake up alive for another day, and also confess all of your sins (big or small).

I just don't like bragging about how many that I won -- but it is 5 Animal Crossing Editions, 2 Splatoon 3 OLEDs and the most recent Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom edition.

Now before you ask this next question, do I still have them all? No, I sold 2 Animal Crossings, used 1 just for my own personal use, and still have 2 left untouched. Both my Splatoon 3 OLEDs are gone (by extremely high demand), but I can't wait to use my Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom edition sometime soon!

YusvIv-6Q24,"I gotta ask man, but how much money did you spend on the arcade and how much did you make back? Not hating or nun, just curious is all.","Oh no, much obliged! I do this because a ton of people on YouTube who subscribed to my channel loves to see this sort of stuff!

Now earlier in 2021 (before I had a YouTube channel) I was making a bit of money off of my winnings. I normally spend $20 to $30 per session (which is basically a few hours down by the arcade each day sometimes) because the tickets come out of the machines the old school way. Waiting for a thousand tickets to come out normally takes 7-8 minutes each jackpot. Then you got the game techs to wait for if the tickets in the machine run out and then to shove all those winnings into the ticket eater sometimes take 90 min depending on how much I won.

It balances out and I lose money because I do play dance games and pinball games that don't give out tickets. At the end, it pretty much balances out. I tell everyone pretty much if you think you can make a living off of this it's better to just buy the PS5 or the Nintendo Switch etc. outright. I pretty much stretch my budget out and it normally equals the same, so if I spend $450 on a Switch for example, I stretch out about $400-500 in 4 weeks and then play those 4 weeks throughout. Gets good publicity (I realized), the owners of the arcade love it and so many people suggested I get a YouTube channel way too many times! I only got into it in 2023 since my hiatus began (too much work, trying to catch up in life. Etc.)

On a good day, I can win about 7000 tickets with $20. Hope that answers your question and thanks for dropping by!

I'd like to posit a take that shows Pegas is more than just a marketing grab (which he no doubt was).
Blade's hero journey is that he is not perfect and the only things that make sense are his family, who he must now turn against. The power he has is his only hope but when that is stripped away he must put aside his raging pain and is forced to place his trust and love in those who accept he is broken and see him as his new family.

K8yp-XogrrQ,I won't lie. Something about case 1 I always loved. I think it was a cool game and nicely made for the most part. Case 2 seemed good too but theres something about the first one I like. Like how u are surviving in one building for the whole game rather then the weird chapter system they have. The chapters are fine but its how some of them are more like dreams that are weird. I definetly would have preferred the game to be more grounded. I also enjoyed how u can have a tablet where ever u go to look out for any animatronics around,"First game: separate chapter in one game

The Europeans had understood that colonialism no longer worked after WW2 and decided to leave but the Arabs in Zanzibar didn't understand this. Zanzibaris wanted more relations with fellow Africans such Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, some sort of pan-African movement was afoot, but Arabs wanted more relations with socialist Egypt. Zanzibaris wanted to be seen as equals with the ruling Arab elite and rule along side with them but the Arabs were too arrogant for that. So the Arabs said they would hold elections and if they won they would rule along side them and the Zanzibaris agreed. Of course the elections were rigged in favour of the Arabs but the Zanzibaris saw through them and asked them how is it that towns with African majorities would vote for Arabs instead of them. Arabs replied it's because you're stupid. So then they began the massacre of the Arabs, when the Zanzibaris had defeated them and demoralised them from fighting any further they took up government. John Okello had instigated more bloodshed against the Arabs but the Zanzibaris didn't want to because they saw them as fellow Muslim brothers.",2020-02-03T20:12:41Z,2020-02-08T03:55:04Z,Prince Liongo: Tragedy Of An Illegitimate Son,27,HomeTeam History,27,Education

She isn't trying to keep secrets from you. She sees you, the player, as essentially being her saviour - her knight in shining armour, come to give her a fresh new reason to carry on living in a world where nothing else really matters. She sees herself as being real, you see, and so with you, the player, also being real, Monika simply assumes that there's no way on Earth you'd actually go ahead and delete her character file, now that she's told you the truth - that she's basically a real human being, trapped in a game world.

She directs you towards her character file because she wants (and perhaps expects) you to protect it for her, which is what makes that hand-holding segment so clever. It's simultaneously giving you a blow-by-blow walk-through of what you need to do next, while at the same time revealing some of Monika's key personality flaws - that she is actually a hopeless romantic who is FAR too trusting for her own good, quite far from being the devious mastermind you may have taken her to be before that point. She's ultimately just a teenage girl who believes that she's finally found the one true love of her life, so to her, pointing you towards her only existing weak spot isn't dangerous - it's actually a show of love and trust. Like I said, she's a hopeless romantic.

So, yeah, you kinda dropped the ball on that one by missing the key message that segment was pointing out to you. Other than that, it was a decent enough review, I suppose. Could have done with a bit less of an attitude, though. 'Cause every now and then, you're not actually as clever as you think you are, y'know?",I think you might be one of the world's most depressing men he mentions at the start of the video.

krq6-1ht_kk,"Mmm. I would say this is a pretty fair review. If a bit too harsh. I say fair because I too pretty much saw most of it coming even having avoided as much spoiler as possible, not reading tags and so on. I just knew it was going to go real dark at some point. The game very blatantly shoves it in your face before it even starts. I understand maybe this was a requirement, this warning, but I would have been substantially more surprised as the game got darker if you didn't go 'WOAH IT'S GOING TO GET DARK'. 

Like I'd have been wondering exactly how far the dark would go. Would they just stop at mental illness for the girls and dig deep in that? Would terrible things start to happen? Could you prevent it? Instead I know it's going to go down the rabbit hole and then you get obvious game run amok vibes and it loses the mystique. To be fair I briefly wondered if the game would go down an entirely different branch of morbid, with how slow the build was, and have an apocalypse and you have to survive with the girls knowing what you know about each of them to your advantage to all live. But then it gets real blunt and there ya go.

It's not badly done in any particular way. But it's not as subtle or nuanced as it needed to be in my opinion to garner the attention it got. I expected more endings and file fiddling for fun in the post game at least. Like, to try a run with only Natsuki and Yuki and get an interesting experience. There's enough to fiddle with for some different experiences and if you're at least amused by it it's pretty fun. Free is probably the right price for it, yeah. Or maybe a few bucks tops. But it's a quality experience for that tier.

Honestly? I would have prefered a game that was just the actual premise. Write poems that affect what path your waifu dating takes. Maybe take out the jumping chibi blatant hints and then that could be pretty darn fun if you ran with it long enough and made it more complex.Then at the end maybe give the option to save all your poems as text files or something. Who knows, maybe they could've given you different poem formats to use for your own poems in the story?

Anyway, TLDR; Yahtzee is pretty right- he often is. But it's maybe a bit too harsh- which he can be now and then. Coulda done more with the game, but what's there is solid if you're into it.

Because, save for one route's climax, it IS a completely bogstandard dating sim. You meet the waifus, go down their branches and get your happy ending and your ""Happy Ending"". However if you go down one girl's branch, then decide that you'd rather not and go down another girl's path you find out some really interesting things: the girl is in love with the Player. Not the MC, the Player playing the game. She then brutally murders the girl you were with, and your character before crashing the game with no survivors. Starting it back up shows the game's glitched out. This game excels and takes things into account like coming back to the game years later. Latest I've seen is a contingency for some guy loading the game ten years later, in which the girl asks about how advanced computers have gotten. She also seems somewhat apologetic.

I know it's probably just a joke (at least I hope it is), but I just wanted to clarify that's not a thing in Brazil, it's even ilegal to marry a family member (even if they're not blood related, like a mother-in-law).","Yes everybody, this is a joke!üòÖ They are a sweet, normal couple who met in the tourist industry.

6awR-bmHmeQ,"The way I see it, Mueller is simply doing a background check on an employee of the United States/the people. I think it's something that should be done when a candidate is nominated for a high office of the US. Probably would have eliminated a lot of candidates for the office and set the stage for a better quality of service and character. Yeah, all politicians have some ""stuff"" in their closets that we may have to decide whether it's significant problem for serving in office, but we'd certainly vet out traitors and threats to our national security before it's too late.

What all this is doing really is highlighting the fact that ""we"" just don't know who we are putting into our highest offices well enough.  The criteria for eligibility needs to be redefined, IMO.  Just because many of the elements of the Constitution were working way back when, doesn't mean it's good for the world we live in now.","Like, is Obama a Saudi-Financed Manchurian Candidate?

Clearly behind the scenes Mueller and the DOJ are really quietly working to take down SPYGATE. They have been working together since McCabe's firing. There are going to be real indictments soon.
