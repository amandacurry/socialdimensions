,,,,"Matthew 6:7 And in praying do not heap up empty phrases (‚Äúvain repetitions‚Äù in KJV) as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.

Notice the context? Jesus said ‚Äúdo not heap up ‚Äòempty phrases‚Äô (Gr. ‚Äì battalagesete,  which means to stammer, babble, prate, or to repeat the same things over and over mindlessly) as the Gentiles do‚Ä¶‚Äù We have to remember that the main idea of prayer and sacrifice among the pagans was to appease the gods so that you could go on with your own life. You had to be careful to ‚Äútake care of‚Äù all of the gods by mentioning them, and saying all the right words, lest you bring a curse upon yourself.
And remember as well, the gods themselves were immoral at times! They were selfish, cruel, vengeful etc. The pagans would say their incantations, offer their sacrifice, but there was no real connection between the moral life and the prayer. Jesus is saying that this will not cut it in the New Covenant Kingdom of God! One must pray from a heart of repentance and submission to God‚Äôs will. But does Jesus mean to exclude the possibility of devotions like the Rosary or the Divine Mercy Chaplet which repeat prayers? No, he does not. This becomes evident when, in the very next verses of Matthew 6, Jesus says:

Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

Jesus gave us a prayer to recite! But notice the emphasis on living the words of the prayer! This is a prayer to be recited, but they are neither ‚Äúempty phrases‚Äù nor ‚Äúvain repetitions.‚Äù

Consider the prayers of the angels in Revelation 4:8:

And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù

These ‚Äúfour living creatures‚Äù refer back to four angels, or ‚ÄúSeraphim,‚Äù that Isaiah saw as revealed in Is. 6:1-3 about 800 years earlier, and guess what they were praying?

In the year that King Uzzi‚Äôah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.‚Äù

Someone needs to inform these angels about ‚Äúvain repetition!‚Äù According to many of our Protestant friends, especially Fundamentalists, they need to knock it off and pray something different! They‚Äôd been praying like that for ca. 800 years!",,,,conflict,youtube,JgtJ-sFzWww,"Mathew 6:6-7
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
