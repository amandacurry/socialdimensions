We owe everything to Jesus Christ who saves us and gives us new life. The Rosary is one of the greatest ways to contemplate his life, death, and resurrection. It makes us reflect his mysteries, and we have the woman who loved and suffered with him before everyone else as our guide towards him. I can't tell you how much peace the Rosary has given me or how many times I've sobbed knowing that I don't deserve His love.
