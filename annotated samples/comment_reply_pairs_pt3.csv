0iZ5-evl_m0,"For new player that don't have much of a grasp of the basics, which come naturally for the vets of the game information like this serves as more of dual edged sword. Making legendries as new a player is not fun; it's a daunting task filled with frustration and pain. Take the new legendary armor, at first glance it seems like all I have to do is collect these materials and or buy these materials and combine it to make prerequisite materials that combine into something else, that is until you start trying to unlock achievements and have to remember what you've already unlocked so you're not wasting materials. And the fact things you unlock and have no need for stay present creating another pitfall for more mistakes, most end up giving up or quitting altogether. What this video does well is make it so more vets of GW2 can essentially make more legendries to flood the market, thus driving the price down so new players have alternate routes for acquisition of sought after items. As a new player taking a break after having issues chasing the legendary gear it's nice to see the community continue to make up for Anets inability to support a good new player experience.","even though I agree with this for legendary armor and stuff like this, for this legendary or generation 3s this is not the case , as it only really requieres a bit of farming and map completion and once you are done you can do it over and over to make gold forever",2024-12-17T00:18:36Z,2024-12-17T00:24:03Z,How many legendary spears can you make a week?,20,Darens To Hero!

all the deldrimor steel ingot is part of the profit calculation idk why you would put that in here.

bzXw-Vs_8mY,I was the bad guy who had been broken up by the dad and let me tell you that was not pretty. I almost punched a 40 year old man in the face because he told me I didn’t know what love was when I tried to explain to him I wanted to marry his daughter. I bet it was way easier for her though because she didn’t have to deal with any of it. She sicked her dad on me like a wild dog and he caused a scene in front of my whole family. It wouldve been so much better for me if she would’ve been the one breaking up with me. Instead everything blew up in my face and it made me feel more alone in my life than I ever have before. I do agree that fathers should step in when a moment comes like this with their daughter as long as they are doing it the right way.

A lot of people are GREAT when the relationship first starts, and then their true colors start to show.

They become dangerous, and it becomes dangerous for them to break up with someone, especially if they become abusive.

Fg7U-BhiZGE,"im not too long into it, but the referrense to coffee imo is a little lush. 

i thought long time addiction is addiction, but the older i get i realise addiction is chosen, please here me out i know this sounds super aggravating. 


we were on coffee, ok hypothethicaly make coffee illegal because of a reason, doesn´t make too much sense because the addicted dont care about your sense! 

you will see the same behavior like we saw in the prohibition time. 

the fact that something is not readily available adds to the factor "" i need it NOW (maybe i cannot get it later bec.[ the dude has no time, he ran out,he might took it himself]""

and i know you think ( no i would never do it over coffee) yeah i know sounds stupid to fight for coffee but people fight over much more stupid stuff, only bec they can. 

and no i don´t want drugs to become legal to use in  no time, because it would screw everyone who wasn´t raised with the knowledge to get it everytime, and you can see it on canabis users, the ones who smoked thou it was illegal have a much more higher distructive behavior to taking it now its legal, because they have it in the back of their minds ( it was illegal, it can become again, so take all the legal till its changing). 

i hope this sounds not like some gibberish, but my native tongue is german, and i hope it sounds logical, i´m a canabis user alcohol user who overtook it so long of a time till i asked myself the question, why ? and i came to the conclusion ( bec of coping) and i know altough i don´t really smoke much cana anymore i would probably smoke more if austria says its legal from now on. 

one of the greatest issues i have with alcohol, you can buy it, you can drink it, but do it too much and youre an outcast who nobody offers help because( they can buy it everywhere so its their fault)they dont have to. its a choice !! 

drug addicts otherwise mostly get met with ( ooooh you poor junkie yeah the bad drugdealers made you use it and now they let you down and your world breaks) 

imo we should collectivelly stop to get into victim mindsets and get souvereign enough as a human beeing to KNOW what to do.

Fg7U-BhiZGE,"As a cancer survivor I don’t think it’s fair to compare alcohol use and addiction to cancer. Sure there are comparable aspects as goes with any disease process but getting and dealing with cancer is not the same as substance use and alcoholism. There is a huge part of addiction that is about choice and choosing to engage with a substance use.

Fg7U-BhiZGE,So she talks about how alcohol related cancer is on the rise and then she talks about meat being the leading cause of colon cancer. Why do doctors not put together that alcohol and meat is made from/ with grain that has been covered with roundup and has been shown to be in our food. Maybe put 2+2 together and realize the rise in cancer is because we cover everything in roundup.,Brilliant connection. I understand that alcohol actually decreases the bodies ability to utilize oxygen and the lack of oxygen leads to cancer as cancer thrives in an anaerobic environment so it's not just 1 thing but I appreciate the link you made!

While I respect the Harvard doctor’s view on alcohol’s negative effects, my experience in the wine industry tells a more nuanced story. I work closely with wine, especially Champagne, and hear inspiring tales of winemakers—many in their 90s or even over 100—who enjoy a daily glass of Champagne and live vibrant, long lives. Wine, when savored mindfully, elevates moments with friends and family, adding joy and connection to life.

Alcohol is well known to burn up b1 and a lot of the body wide damage comes from that. B1 is not present much in many foods so you won't get good levels back fast via normal eating.  B1 is also a vitamin that it's nearly impossible to overdose on so it's pretty safe. Take daily for at least a few months to help recover from past damage, if there is a lot of damage, years are recommended, it is possibly to slowly regain some of the lost brain function by doing this.  If you should fall off the alcohol wagon (or for anyone still drinking), be sure to take b1 daily that entire time to protect your brain function. Try to take the b1 pill when there is no alcohol going down with it if possible for better absorption.

I've been sober for almost 2 years now after 15 years of wasting my life drinking. The discourse around it is so strange when you consider any other drug of comparable danger. ""How much cocaine is the right amount I should have daily to really get my heart pumping"" is just not a sentence you'll EVER hear. But ""How many glasses a night will give me heart health benefits?"" is a VERY common question. I do see the rate of drinking among youth going down (although to be fair, we've never had youths as square as this generation, lol), so that's good.

aqz-KE-bpKQ,"OK, on my flash player, in Firefox, this is NOT 60fps via youtube. So likely you think it is 60fps, but it is not. I downloaded big buck bunny in 60fps, so I can tell the difference. If it looks exactly like all the other videos on youtube, it is NOT 60fps, that is something you notice. Many people object to it, to the superior quality and temporal resolution, because they are so used to the old 80 year old system, that was, btw. never intended for quality reasons, but more to reduce the cost of film.
 Sadly so far, no movies on youtube that are advertised to be 60 fps actually are, they are all down rendered to 24 fps.

It is a good case of when you order expensive fancy wine in a restaurant, but can't tell the difference between really good one and bad one and the you then exclaim: ""Oh, wow, yeah, I can tell the difference""
A good test to see if something is really 60 fps is to run one version that is normal (24fps) in one window and the other one in one Windows, try that with this video and... you will see, absolutely NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever...
Another trick is also to see below in the youtube quality settings, to see if there is anything mentioned about 60 fps, if not, well, there you go.","Actually, this video does play in 60fps, like many other 60 and 48fps videos that are now available on YouTube.

6W4LPd-ykA4,"I really appreciated the breakdown on volume studies done by ""house of hypertrophy.""  Putting all the significant study findings together they estimated that the best number of ""working"" sets ranged from 10-20 per bodypart per week.  I like to train 2 x week for each and aim for the lower end of the spectrum due to natural recovery limitations.  As I get older, and have more muscle to support from gains, I find that even 10 sets a week is too much for every body part.  But, that range seems to make plenty of sense imo.  And, it's somewhat where Dorian really landed volume wise if you break it down- especially do to the heavy weight used with compound movements- a lot of crossover parts worked, like biceps when doing rows.",I err on the side of less also.

They look at range, but I look at things like - no more oil changes, no exhaust system, no liquid cooling system, the hundreds of moving parts down to a fraction, etc etc. That is the real benefit and once people start to really see that aspect, it will mark the end of the ICE and bout 85% of all mechanics will find themselves out of work.

I believe they pay for this information. I am happy for any mechanics on here to correct me if I am wrong.
So if the book says 4hrs, then they will charge 4hrs at their shop rate, say $100/hr. So $400.
Now if they invest in tools, equipment and training and get the job done in 10min, it is still a $400 job, you are not getting inferior parts or work, so it has the same value.
What your are likely to find is that they will sharpen their pencil some to be more competitive than other local shops, but they certainly would not charge for only 10min work.

Just watched this. True Respect for that rotating engine stand. 
The mechanics in the room clearly will be sold by the convenience of the tool but, as an engineer, true respect for its ability to be turned by a cordless drill. 
You can gear stuff down all you want but, looking at the speed of rotation coming from that small driver, you did this by removing almost all the load from those threads. Those must be some monster bearings and spaced well apart. And what is the diameter of the, I don't know what you call it, the axle of the thing.
There is a balance issue as well. Are those ""sandwich"" plates all designed to hold the engine with so its center of mass is in line with the rotation?","With the engine specific mounting plate, we aim the get a fully dressed engine on centre of rotation. We all know that during the build process the centre of rotation changes, and so too does the mass. If  the built engine is too far off centre, then you put excessive load on the gearbox, resulting in premature wear.
An offset load has very little effect on the head assembly. Only the overhang. We limit the load the engine stand can handle by the bearings and main shaft.
The main shaft starts out life as a large billet piece. Fro memory the diameter of the flange is about 150-160mm. The bearing housing on this particular engine stand (900kg/2000lb) is 89mm.

qBc1Ba-0o9E,"neat tool, but I see one, glaring problem. Hydraulics would make it very easy to try to force a bad part onto the crank and that would pull out the threads on the crank..... part of the reason to use hand tools is if the balancer is improperly machined, you'll feel it .... maybe some kind of bypass or limiter so you don't put 100 tons on the threads... given manufacturer's hidden chinese parts - that happens way too often even with high-end parts.","Good point. I like to use a pressure gauge especially when using the air/hydraulic, electric or battery pumps. This way you can tell very quickly if something is not right.
