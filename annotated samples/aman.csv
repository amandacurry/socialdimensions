,,,,"I think your dealer pricing is highway robbery. My K1100 was costing less to run than equivalent Honda and Kawasaki, never found out about Yamaha, but probably the same. I have had the clutch replaced with original parts for approximately $2000 Australian dollars. A complete tear down of the K100 was $1700 to replace all gearbox seals and the input shaft, at about 200,000 Km. Anyone familiar with the K100 knows this is inevitable on K100 bikes. My K100&K1100 both made 300,000 Km before selling. Been pretty happy with K series but K1600 is too heavy for an old blighter like me(nearly 70!).",,,,respect,youtube,X7J3-4mC6ws,"My K 1200 LT, with this basic design Engine, if I parked it on the side stand, and returned shortly after parking. When I started the machine, it poured smoke out the exhaust like a Kawasaki 500 / 2 stroke tripple..
  I complained to my dealer about it. He said that’s normal.
  If the clutch slave cylinder leaked onto the clutch. which was not uncommon, the slave cylinder, and the clutch, had to be replaced… an acquaintance of mine was a mechanic at a BMW motorcycle shop… that is when I found this out and I was very interested because at the time I had The same machine that was being operated on on the mechanics bench.
  it was 2010. he had the rear wheel, the bodywork, the trunk, the seats, the rear frame section, the swingarm, the transmission, and who knows what else removed when he called me over to take a look at what my bike looks like in the work required to change the clutch.. I asked him what a job like this costs..
  he paused as he looked at me for my reaction. He said approximately $4500, Plus parts,plus disposal fee, Plus shop materials, Plus tax.
that was in 2010, 2010 prices…
  I have had dozens of bikes over the past five decades. Venture’s, goldwings, Sport bikes, commuters, dual sports, dirt bikes, trails bikes, road racing machines, lots of makes.. gas gas, beta,fantic, moto guzzi, Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, Bridgestone, and one BMW..
  108 so far.
  The most disappointing motorcycle I ever owned was the BMW K 1200 LT. It had the second best seat I ever owned, the motor made adequate power, nice widely spaced transmission complemented the broad torque power band of the engine. I loved the heated seat and grips.. it had a great headlight. The cruise control was among the best i have had.. my wife loved the heated seat and heated back rest. reverse came in handy.
BUT:::
 I was looking for a remote campground where my friends were camping… I got a little lost, and I had to turn around. I ended up going down a fairly steep paved road covered with fly ash/cinders. no problem, I’ve had decades of off-road riding experience on slippery surfaces…I tapped the brakes going down that fairly steep hill covered with cinders, and I wasn’t ready for this, I had no brakes at all..Nothing. I pumped the brakes, nothing front or rear. That was my first experience with ABS brakes on slippery surface’s..The motorcycle ABS computer detected slippage, so it shut the brakes off. I suppose ABS really stands for, all braking stops.. so there I was going down the slope of a road in the middle of nowhere with no brakes on a 900 pound motorcycle. There was a 90° turn coming up at the bottom of this hill. Luckily, about 20 feet off the road there was an 8 foot high cyclone fence around some type of auto salvage business.. I went straight off the road through the grass and into the fence with my front wheel. The only damage I had was a broken front fender..
  after I replaced the fender, I decided change the brake fluid and the clutch fluid. I used to be a motorcycle mechanic and several different dealerships, no big deal to change brake fluid and clutch fluid.. actually it is a big deal with a BMW. I did research on the Internet, and people on blogs said, don’t even attempt to try this job yourself because, if you get air in the system, the system will detect that and shut down completely front and back wheel.. he will then have to trailer the bike to the dealer to have the dealer plug the machine into its diagnostics terminal to reset the ABS after they bleed the brakes.
  I didn’t believe that, so I bought the plastic vessel for holding more brake fluid that attaches to the reservoir for the brake fluid. Because the brakes on this machine were electric, hydraulic. The key must be on to activate the servo pump, to pass the brake fluid through the system… The reservoir is so tiny and the servo will suck that brake fluid out of there so fast, that you will get air in the system if you’re not careful. And when that happens, you are screwed.
  I called the dealer and asked how much it would be to have my brake fluid changed. Three month wait, $750, plus parts, plus shop materials, plus disposal fee, plus tax
   I did the job myself, taking my good old time being very careful with brake fluid and being careful not to get air in the system. It took me less than an hour..
   while I was doing research online about maintenance since this was my very first BMW. I read everything. While doing research I found that it is not uncommon to have the final drive bearings fail.. I read the two guys that were entered in the iron butt , actually carried a spare final drive housing with them.. that’s how much they knew.
   aside from all the nice things I liked about the bike, I thought the windshield was unacceptably distorted for $22,000 motorcycle. The self alarming security system was a pain. It would reset even after a five minute gas stop. I had to dig in my pockets to pull out the key fob to push the button to unlock the security system to start the bike to continue on my trip every time I got gas..
  that BMW had a weird front end. You could not compress the suspension by pressing on it, by pumping the bars, you could not get that front end to go down, but, the front wheel would only come up when you hit irregularities in the road.The result of that system is, when you are in a parking lot doing tight turns at low speeds, And you tap the brakes at low speed, that kinetic energy of you moving normally would go into the front fork springs and be dissipated. But the front end on that machine does not compress from braking.. that energy has nowhere to go, and if you have the handlebars turned slightly, you better have strong legs and they better be long because you are going to be struggling to hold that machine up. I never dropped any of my three Yamaha ventures that I had close to 290 miles combined on, I never dropped my GL 1800 Goldwing, but I drop that BMW K 1200 LT two times in slow speed parking lot situation’s.
  I mentioned that to a group of 3K 1200 owners I bumped into at a motorcycle bike night. They all three started laughing and one of them walked me over to his bike. His mirrors were scarred, he said everybody drops them..look at both of my mirrors. he said the reason my mirror isn’t replaced is because they cost $490 each…The other 2 K1200 owners also agreed, they had dropped their machines also. That is one weird front end, and I now realize why no other manufacturer in the world has attempted to copy it…
   The rear brakes on my BMW made a horrible metal on metal grinding noise so loud, that people would turn to see what that noise was as I would be slowing down at stop signs and red lights. I mentioned this to my dealer. He said we can fix that. I say well what do you have to do. He said, and aftermarket rotor and pads. I asked how much is that. he said approximately $800, plus short material, plus disposal fee, plus tax
   I started to develop a different braking reflex.. it was not automatic, I had to think about it every time. And what I was doing differently was, I was not using the rear brake in slow speed areas, leaving my right hand free to finesse the throttle in conjunction with my left hand working the clutch at slow speeds. I had to start breaking with my right hand in these slow speeds, not touch the back brake, because of that embarrassing grinding noise…It was an awkward distraction because I would revert back to my normal braking habits, resulting in that screeching grinding noise.
 I had finally had enough. I thought they were the best machines , Because the most seasoned group of riders were the BMW riders,At least the ones that rode the air cooled twins were…
  I sold that machine, I had enough.. I was disappointed. I went out and bought a Moto Guzzi Norge, with heated grips, electric windshield, a pretty good seat, and ABS brakes that could be turned off at the push of a button, for those times when you get caught on a steep gravel covered road, or on wet grass on a slope, or get caught in the snow which I have had happened to me on several occasions. Luckily I was on machines that did not have ABS brakes so I made it home with brakes… and Norge was my fourth guzzi.. I rode that machine for 14 years, no problem, 30 minute valve adjustment, I didn’t even have to remove the gas tank.. wonderful loping torquey motor…
  I thought I was buying the most wonderful most advanced machine capable of traveling for hundreds of thousands of miles when I bought that BMW. That was the most disappointing motorcycle of my life. I will never buy another BMW. …You have to marry the dealer…
  before I get a lot of BMW owners pissed off at me. I sold my Norge a couple years ago and bought a Honda GL 1800 Goldwing. That was the first perfect motorcycle of my life. It was perfect. It did everything perfectly. it’s the smoothest thing in the universe, the ride will put you to sleep, it’s also perfectly boring. It had about as much personality as my toaster. So I sold it, and went back to a non-ABS motorcycle. A 2008 Yamaha venture. That is my touring machine at the moment.. it ain’t perfect, it is very comfortable and much roomier than the gold wing, I can get to the clutch, the slave cylinder, the water pump, the stator in minutes, they are not buried under plastic panels. They’re right there on the sides of the engine. I could practically service them with the tool kit if necessary. It does everything the Goldwing does except reverse..And, it gets 48 miles to the gallon so far. My Goldwing only got 33 miles to the gallon.. I had my first Yamaha venture for 16 years 138,000 trouble-free miles. I like  them.. that’s a great fairing. If it gets too hot to ride behind that fairing, I’ll ride one of my other bikes that don’t have fairings..

More of why he was here when it is Flea that lives here, they worked on the “I’m With You” cd here, so they did a secret show at Henry Miller Library, a tiny little outdoor place under the trees.

Listen to “Road Trippin’, he mentions Big Sur. That is a song you should learn.",,,,,instagram,,,,,,,,,,,1.8037916206061284e+16,carmelmoose,1551196867.0,power

I wasn’t easily categorized which led to a lot of alienation within the small communities of color I had access to in the suburbs of Miami. As I’ve gotten older this isn’t so much the case bc I’m now part of a community that understands the nuances of my identity. But, yeah, I used to feel like I was straddling b/w identities that didn’t fully accept or affirm me.
