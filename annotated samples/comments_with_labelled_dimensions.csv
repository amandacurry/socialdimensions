TE4eplsFSms,Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously),Sam,way easier than learning chinese characters. Chinese characters are just the practice of torturing yourself until you remember them. Its frankly amazing that Chinese even functions at all considering how bad the language is.,@Whatsup_Abroad,2024-05-09T12:55:59Z,"Korean and European letters/characters represent the sound. Chinese characters represent the meaning. A characters initially was literally a drawing for a certain thing. It allows people who speak similar languages to communicate. The pinyin system is the phonetic system for Chinese characters and it acts like a phonetic language similar to English. For example, an idea, let's say the idea of ""snake"". In English it is ""snake"", in other European languages it is something different. In German it is ""Schlange"". Now imagine you use an image of snake to represent a snake. And everyone, English or German, draw the same image for a snake no matter how you pronounce it as your written language. In Mandarin snake is 蛇，in Cantonese it is 蛇，in Japanese it is 蛇，but just pronounced differently.  Chinese is also much faster to read for native speakers thanks to the characters. Also, Chinese makes words using its own root, it derives from itself, unlike English vocabulary mess where even native speakers might have no idea what those medical words mean when they are in a hospital talking with a doctor.",@wyuxing,2024-05-16T18:50:27Z,True,True,True,16,knowledge

For 'ㄱ', if there is one more line it becomes 'ㅋ'. And it has the K sound.
And for 'ㄷ', it can be 'ㅌ'. (like the previous one) And it has the T sound.

Also, 'ㅂ, ㄱ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㄷ' can be doubled like 'ㅃ, ㄲ, ㅆ, ㅉ, ㄸ'.
This way, the sound gets more thicker.
ex) You pronounce '사' like 'Sa' but pronounce '싸' like 'Sssssa'.

As a Korean I can't really suggest how to memorize these since it is too familiar for me,
But these are the all the basice of Korean letters and memorizing these you will be able to read most of the korean words.

I then walked around town without a plan just going anywhere and reading signs as I went. I would already know 10 words so I just mixed and matched what I knew to figure out the signs in the beginning. 

1 month later I was done learning the Korean alphabet and I knew the town as well. The first word I learned was Pizza or 피자.

Just these few words are already 15 characters but all you need to learn are 5 simple words you already know. 

For example, If you know 김치 (kimchi) and 피자 (pizza/pijja) you know 7 characters. If you then look at the word 미친 (crazy) you can understand 4 of the 5 characters without learning anything besides 2 simple words you already know.

But back to the original commenter's point, this video is a tad misleading because you are only learning the words that are common between Korean and English, such as Samsung. Obviously not all Korean words have a direct corollary to English like this.

Korean, Spanish, Greek (to name a few) have a clear expected sound when a word is read, without different pronunciations based on individual words. 
I learned how to read Korean because I learned the sounds of the letters (and their combinations) so I can now pronounce what I see.

 Hangul is deliberately created to be easy to read and write. Back then, knowing how to read and write was a privilege. The king wanted all his people to read and write without having any difficulty, so that they could thrive their ideas and opinions. Then the king came up with the idea of making alphabets for the public and he created them on his own(And this is from the official record. The king made them clear : the reason why he creats Hangul and what he aims for, just like when the modern scientists write their papers).

 Sejong the great is highly respected in South Korea(not sure about North Korea)and his portrait is on one of South Korean banknotes(10,000 won). You can also find the statue of Sejong the great in Seoul.

Obviously you don't automatically ""understand"" the language.

TE4eplsFSms,Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously),Sam,"about how to pronounce in korean, im not korean nor am i extremely fluent but i know a few things here and there and i can string up a basic sentence and make myself understood. a lot of native speakers think im korean because my pronunciation is good but once i started making full sentences they know im not 💀

so basically, the key to speaking and pronouncing korean properly is to not go too literally by the romanisation. for example: 
banana should be ba-na-na by the romanisations right? well, no. if a native said it, it would sound almost like pan-na-na (not pan as in frying pan, like p-ah-n, an ah sound) because the b sound in korean is almost between a b and p and the more you learn korean, the more you'll find that almost all their consonants don't have a definitive english alphabet sound, it hovers between 2 similar sounds. 

b= between b and p 
l= between l and r 
g= between g and k 
j= between j and ch (not rlly but almost) 
s= between s and tso (not like so, like s-or but without r sound) 
d= between d and t 
k= between k and g

i'm not explaining it the best way, but all i can say is watch more korean stuff, be it kpop, kdrama, k tv shows,k content basically. once you hear the native speakers speaking you'll understand what i mean, theres 2 sounds in one. and watching such content will also allow you to learn more abt korean culture, slang etc. trust me, i've watched so much korean content that sometimes i can understand some parts without subs and nope i've never invested into properly studying korean because i am way too lazy for my own good💀

but yea, keep looking at the subtitles and pay attention to what they're saying, if you hear the same word constantly being repeated, think back at the subtitles to see what word matches all, then you'll know what it means. but remember, subs are pretty shitty sometimes (cough squid game eng subs) but most are fine and this way you'll improve quite a lot. you definitely wont learn proper grammar and sentence structure this way, but you'll pick up lots of words, and thats what im doing right now. if you're looking to learn to speak korean, take this advice, when you're speaking korean, throw away all the english language rules and use that of the korean language",@sarahhh9136,2021-10-08T15:13:11Z,"@@deviltriggers glad i could help. if you're learning korean i hope you improve quickly, good luck!",@sarahhh9136,2021-10-10T02:19:40Z,True,True,True,2,social_support

TE4eplsFSms,Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously),Sam,So it's literally just consonant-vowel-consonant? That...That's fucking insanely easy!! Holy crap!!,@FerreTrip,2021-06-18T23:04:22Z,"for the most part yes! 
(this is a bit long oops. if ur not interested in reading an entire mini essay on korean syllables u can just ignore this lol)

korean syllables can also be just a vowel (+ the ㅇ that he covered because it must come before a vowel at the beginning of a syllable). they can also have a double consonant, or two final consonants.

a double consonant is just what it sounds like, a doubled consonant. they're placed in the spot that single consonants would go in. two repeating consonants will make the consonant sound more intense or sharp.
(ex: 뽀뽀, a word for ""kiss"", is two ㅂ put beside each other before the vowel ㅗ)
(ex 2: 있어, literally meaning ""(___) exists"", has two ㅅ at the end of the syllable) 

the final consonant, aka the consonant at the end of the syllable, can be a double consonant OR have two final consonants that are different.
when this (two different final consonants) is followed by a vowel, both consonants will be pronounced. when it's followed by a consonant, only one will be pronounced. the final consonants have a name, it's called 받침 (batchim). there are many rules to 받침. there are a lot of different combinations of two final consonants so going over all of them would take too much time for this reply lol. if ur interested i suggest u google it :]
(ex: 앉아, meaning ""sit down"", has ㄴ and ㅈ in the final consonant position. if followed by a consonant, only the ㄴ consonant will be pronounced. this is an example of one of the 받침 rules; when ㄴ and ㅈ are the 받침, only the ㄴ will be pronounced when followed by another consonant)

some korean vowels are a combination of two vowels he covered here. they perform the same as two different consonants put together, but just in the vowel place.
(ex: 와르르, a word for the sound of something crumbling, has the vowels ㅗ and ㅏ in the first syllable. it sounds like ""wa"", the sound that would come out if you said 오아 very quickly like trying to force it into one syllable)

edit: although this sounds like a lot, all korean syllables follow a structure. once you learn all of the consonants and vowels, the syllables pretty much make themselves (memorizing 받침 is where it gets difficult). the only reason it seems like a whole lot is because in the video, only single consonants and vowels were covered, but i mean, those simple things are the segway to learning more about the language and writing system!!",@user-fw1rb2hk3f,2021-06-26T02:09:05Z,True,True,True,20,fun

TE4eplsFSms,Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously),Sam,"I'm trying to learn Korean too! Guys, a tip: I was taught that Romanizing Hangeul (한글) makes it harder to read the actual letters fast. Because you double the ""translation"" process in your head:
1, recognizing the letter
2, mentally transposing it to the Romanized version
3 ,recalling the sound it makes.
Of course this process takes fractions of a millisecond in our brains, but it's still double the process than if we just memorized what the actual Korean letters sound like.
It's because some Romanizations can get confusing if English was your primary language. For example: eo (어), eu (으), ui (의), oe (외)-- none of these sounds like the way it's spelled (unless someone already taught us how these syllables sound) So, if we're Romanizing, we're essentially learning TWO symbols instead of one.

We don't have to follow this strictly. It's just an advice I was given, and just wanted to share. Happy learning!",@Jonathan331,2021-05-29T02:17:55Z,"well that's just because you're not trained in languages enough to understand why ""eo"" ""eu"" ""ui"" and ""oe"" make perfect sense even sound-wise as romanizations.

Vowels: ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡㅓ ㅕ ㅏ ㅑ ㅣ ㅐ ㅔ 

ㅂ: Translated as B, but is actually unvoiced and thus a soft P. What it means to be soft is to have no aspiration, or a puff of air- like the P in ""spoon."" 
ㅍ: P. 
ㄷ: Unvoiced. No aspiration. ""T"" noise. 
ㅌ: T. 
ㄱ: Unvoiced. No aspiration. ""K"" noise. 
ㅋ: K. 
ㅅ: Unvoiced. S noise. 
ㅆ: Not really a specific way to explain what this means, but it's just a more sudden, more intense S noise.
ㅈ: Translated as J, however it is closer to ""Ch,"" minus the aspiration.
 ㅉ: More intense, unaspirated ""Ch"" noise. 
ㅊ: Ch. 
ㅁ: M. 
ㄴ: N, however the tongue is placed between the teeth rather than on the fleshy part above them. Sounds kind of like ""D"" sometimes. 
ㅇ: Silent unless at the end of a syllable block, where it becomes ""ng."" Do NOT pronounce a hard G at the end of it, just gently place your tongue in the spot where the ""ng"" noise is made. 
ㄹ: Sometimes translated as R, sometimes translated as L, however it is never technically either. Nonetheless, it is generally what we call a ""rolled R"" whenever it's at the beginning of a syllable block, and generally it's a very long, gentle L whenever at the bottom of one. I can't really describe what the L sounds like (but you can imagine the R,) so you'll just have to listen to someone pronouncing it. 
ㅎ: H.

It's important to note that all of these can change depending on their placement, and sometimes they can even change without any real reason- just like any alphabet.

ㅗ: O. The pronunciation is shorter and deeper than English. We have somewhat of an ""oo"" noise after most of our O's, but this doesn't happen in Korean. 
ㅛ: Yo. 
ㅜ: U like ""goo."" 
ㅠ: Yu. 
ㅡ: Eu. There is no real English equivalent, but I think of it as being a very.. plain vowel. Imagine making a noise with your mouth mostly in a relaxed state. It's like just humming a random noise. I think it sounds kind of like a cross between ""uh"" and ""oo.""
ㅓ: Eo. A lot of people compare this to ""uh,"" however I think it sounds like ""ah"" and ""oh"" combined. It's almost like saying ""ah,"" but pushing your tongue further back into your throat?? 
ㅕ: Yeo. 
ㅏ: A as in ""ah."" 
ㅑ: Ya. 
ㅣ: I as in the ""Inu"" in ""Shiba Inu"" (as well as the the i in ""shiba"") 
ㅐ: Ae. Pronounced like ""eh."" 
ㅔ: E. Also pronounced like ""eh."" Exactly the same as ㅐ.
ㅒ: Yae. Like ""yeh""
ㅖ: Yeh.

As with the consonants, the pronunciations in vowels, as well, can change from word to word, placement to placement. For help with remembering..

TE4eplsFSms,Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously),Sam,"Actually korean alphabet is based on
The inside mouth's look

When you say ㄱ
Your tongue will bend just like alphabet
ㄴ makes your tongue bend more to up
And touchs behind of the teeth

I just wanna talk that technique as
Matching with shape with sound
Makes easy to remember 
But it's pretty fun to think the letters are acutally made by shape of inside mouth and throat 

And ㅏㅓㅡㅣ is combinations of 
ㆍ(sky) ㅡ (ground)ㅣ(human- which connects sky and ground)

ㅏ = ㅣ+ㆍ
ㅓ=  ㆍ+ㅣ
Just like that

TE4eplsFSms,Learn to Read Korean in 5 Minutes (seriously),Sam,"for anybody that doesn’t know the difference between ㅔ and ㅐthey are actually very different but many non native speakers usually pronounce them the same(as ay) which idk why lmfao they’re very different. 
ㅔ is pronounced eh. just like a canadian lmfao “eh?” and ㅐ is ae just like play or tae. when the two lines are added they become ㅖ(yeh) ㅒ(yae) i’m self taught in hangul and it took me about 20 minutes to learn. i’m also self taught in hiragana/katakana which have taken me three days to learn. i also grew up bilingual and speak native english and fluent levantine arabic, though i cant read arabic which is funny and kind of an irony. 
the way i made it easy to understand pronunciation and grammar i usually watch kpop lyric videos and read the hangul and listen to how it’s pronounced in the song, or watch korean shows and listen to them speak when captions are added(because we all know koreans love to add captions to their shows). if the pronunciation isn’t clear enough i usually put it into google translate and listen to the audio. hangul is very easy good luck to everybody still learning! 화이팅! 

PS i realized other characters he’s forgotten to add to the video is
ㅌ t (looks like an E but pronounced as T so think of ET)
ㅍ p (he’s added this in the video but an easier way to remember it is that it looks like the symbol for Pi)
ㅋ k (looks like a Key 🗝) 
other characters include 
ㅃ bb (pronounced like a P)
ㅉ jj (its like ㅈ but more emphasized)
ㄲ gg (pronounced like a K)
ㅆ ss (its like ㅅ but more emphasized) 

extra tip for grammar lesson, when ㅅ(s) is next to the vowels ㅣㅕㅑㅒㅖㅛㅠ it’s pronounced with an sh

It seems redundant.",@Kamadev888,2017-01-01T19:27:46Z,"So in Korean each block / character (which I shall now refer to as hangeul), becomes just one complete syllable. When written, it must always start with a consonant, and then be followed by a vowel. So like 바, 저, 도, 니, 무, 르 (Ba, jeo, do, ni, mu, reu). However in Korean pronunciation it doesn't always start with a consonant sound. You can just pronounce the vowels on their own. The writing system is designed to always start with a consonant, so that is where ㅇ comes in. It becomes a placeholder character when writing. So in all of these, the only thing you pronounce is the vowel: 아이오우어애에여요야으유 (a, i, o, u, eo, ae, e, yeo, yo, ya, eu, yu)

Why does ㅇ mean two things? Well I'm not 100% on this but from what I understand. It was originally invented to only be a blank character. It is supposed to denote a zero and was made purely as a placeholder that makes no sounds. I think I heard that the original Ng character was more like ㆁ, but they merged the two together a couple of centuries ago. It works because unlike all the other characters in Korean, the Ng sound can't exist at the start of a sound. So it becomes a multi-use consonant.

English is a melting pot of many different languages, including French, which is why it is probably easier to you. However, English is a complicated language,  because of how many different languages had an influence in it. English has many different rules that contradict one another. For example, an apostrophe shortens a word into a contraction(That's: That is), and also can also create a  positive noun (Bob's boat). However, one exception are the words ""it's"" and ""its"", because ""it"" is a singular noun. ""It's"" is a contraction, meaning ""it is"". However, ""its"" is a positive noun. (Example: Don't touch its food. In this case, ""Don't touch it is food,"" has an entirely different meaning and is grammatically incorrect.) This is just only example of the layers of complexity you have to go through with English. In conclusion, English is one of the hardest languages, and most complex, because of the many rules. [Side note, if you still aren't convinced: can't = can not. The apostrophe takes the place of the ""o"".  Don't = do not. Agian, the apostrophe takes the place of the ""o"". Then what the f*** happens with won't. The words that go into it are will and not. If we go by the previous two examples, it should be willn't.

Learning it by yourself seems to be impossible, You may be familiar with the hiragana and katakana of Japanese.

For learning the Korean alphabet, which is a system that combines consonants and vowels in a particular way that never changes, this might help some people(also, people's brains are different. I learned English one way and my friend learned it another way but we both speak and write it fine). The system can be explained as a primary sound(consonant), then on the right of it is the middle sound(vowel), then on the bottom is the end sound(consonant). The end sound can be described as optional, since there are sounds such as '가 or as you like in romanization ga' which don't need and will be distorted if an end sound exists. Anyways, as long as you remember what the characters look like(there are only 24 characters, and that's including the consonants and the vowels. There are actually more that look different, but if you break them down, they are combinations of the 24 characters. Another factor is that the way he's learning to remember the characters are fairly what King Sejong wanted. He modeled the consonants after how our tongues, mouth, and throat look like when we make the sound and the characters that are made from similar mouth shapes and tongue positions look similar to each other. Like ㅈ and ㅊ which are 'j sound ' and 'ch sound'. He also modeled the vowels based on sky, earth and other stuff from nature.)and know how the system works, then you can basically know how to read anything aloud in Hangul(한글, it should actually be romanized to han-geul). Though learning the Korean language is a different story. That requires experience in speaking, listening, writing and reading(and comprehending).

It is based on the fact that radioactive elements have half-life periods that ca be calculated .... some have very short lives but many have very large half lives ,,,

for eg:-- Hydrogen-7 isotope has half life of 23 yoctoseconds (2.3×10−23 seconds).
and  Tellurium-128's half-life is over 160 trillion times longer than the universe has existed !!!

The idea behind radiocarbon dating is straightforward, but years of work were required to develop the technique to the point where accurate dates could be obtained. Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of 14
C in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, in the form of a calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of 14
C in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of 14
C throughout the biosphere (reservoir effects)

The method was developed by Willard Libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists. Libby received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1960.

They don't appear at burial places, palaces  or even some other temple sites like Abu Simbel. So a Pharaoh would have sent his men to make this obelisk for a specific temple, and when they found the crack they abandoned it. So even if they could make a smaller one there was no one else to sell it to. 


Also the crack is smack in the middle, so they actually would not have been able to make a smaller one. 


And the really hard work was to come. They only cut the three sides roughly. They still had to cut underneath, and then use hand tools to make it perfectly smooth. Then they would have to  lift it by hand to the river and take it by boat to the Temple site. Then, using simple hand tools, intricately carve hieroglyphs into it.

He also won 4 Italian Cups, 4 italian Supercups, the Champions League and the World Cup. Materazzi is an Inter Milan LEGEND!",@Allzumenschliches44,2014-04-08T14:49:47Z,True,True,True,6,conflict

Obviously someone never stood up to anyone.
Even if he was playing infront of the Queen he would have done that.
Its something called respect. Fight for it.",@moey558,2011-09-05T07:57:31Z,"Respect is earned, not faught for. That's fear and your own insecurities that you are fighting. This is someone that couldn't handle an opposing talking smack(which happens all the time in all sports) and got manipulated into doing exactly what he did. You can try to explain away weakness and a lack of restraint for the sake of your team with some kind of false bravado if you want. I just see someone that is played like a puppet and uses a cheap shot sucker punch headbutt because he had his feelings hurt like a child. Your little hero is pretty pathetic.",@davidmurphy1207,2020-07-13T20:31:43Z,True,True,True,6,conflict
