But CD has a flat frequency response from 20HZ to 20KHz and a much greater dynamic range and adds no audible noise or distortion to the signal. When the recording and mastering is done well a CD is absolutely superior to  even the best vinyl in every way. Vinyl has so many physical problems that affect the sound in a negative way from compromising the sound quality for cutting the laqurer to production and pressing the copies and then the playback equipment at the end.

I'm from Eastern Europe, grew up in NYC and family is also very important in our culture. There was a time for years that I thought they don't care and there's no going back or fixing it. Felt betrayed and cast out. Again, don't know your situation but in my case I played a massive role in that. Life is never that simple and they also played their part and made mistakes. But, eventually I realized it was my actions that were the catalyst for everything else that happened after. I had so much anger and resentment that at a time I truly believed that was it. It was a long journey, one that I'm still on, but today my family is in my life and I have their support and love. I'm grateful for it and don't take it for granted. I pray and hope that you can say the same one day. Again, I don't know your situation and unfortunately, sometimes there is no fixing it. Then again sometimes miracles do happen. I thought for sure there was no going back. There are still good people in the world and sometimes people that aren't blood will give you the love that family can't or won't at the time. I wish you all the best and will pray for you. ( I'm not a religious nut but I do believe in a creator and I do pray) there are places and people that you can reach out to when things get overwhelming. 💪🙏✊️❤️",youtube,x4yk-LQhn_I,2025-04-08T03:26:57Z,People & Blogs,1

Also CD rot only affects CDs stored in cold damp places.

The only times I've experienced CD Rot are when I've bought CDs either second hand or off online stores but this was only twice in about 300 hundred purchases.,youtube,4CUV-WDDKOM,2015-12-21T04:02:35Z,People & Blogs,1

Charity to the homeless for example, basic human rights, and I see this being ignored by many, but Christianity was the religion in the early Middle Ages that outlawed slavery. For the most part most Christians don't consider the argument ""if you don't believe in God yourself to be God"", and I haven't heard of the argument for the most part. In the case of why we believe in God, it's quite simple, if the universe was able to be created by a few atoms colliding, and the rules of the universe were created by atoms colliding, why is everything not going to mayhem with millions of atoms. More so, the universe is constantly expanding, so why isn't there a new set of rules made for the entire universe for every inch of the universe created? If nothing can make a large set of rules, then something should be able to create infinitely more rules to the universe, that is usually the overarching problem with not believing in a God.",youtube,E8zj-jtNh6U,2023-04-21T03:09:37Z,People & Blogs,4

He swapped the infill hose from cold to hot and pointed out that it was filling properly now but we had to be aware that the hot fill hose may be little to harsh for delicates etc. We couldn't understand why the cold fill hose had always been alright with our previous washing machine and not with this new Hotpoint. To cut a long story short, we put the hose back onto the cold fill tap as it should have been all along albeit taking longer to fill, but discovered that that the softener dispenser still didn't empty properly. After trial and error we discovered that after the end of whatever cycle you choose and you check if the softener has gone, then its worked, but I have found a way to make this work. After the cycle has finished and the softener is still in the drawer, just turn your dial to spin and pump out. This only takes 10 minutes but at least you get the softener into your laundry. This shouldn't have happened right from the beginning but trying to get the engineer to understand that was a almost impossible. I was ready to get Hotpoint to collect the machine and I would go back to my beloved Boche make. I do hope this helps you to understand this problem with Hotpoint.",youtube,MsZL-__HHW0,2020-10-07T12:45:46Z,Howto & Style,2

We all know that during the build process the centre of rotation changes, and so too does the mass. If  the built engine is too far off centre, then you put excessive load on the gearbox, resulting in premature wear.
An offset load has very little effect on the head assembly. Only the overhang. We limit the load the engine stand can handle by the bearings and main shaft.
The main shaft starts out life as a large billet piece. Fro memory the diameter of the flange is about 150-160mm. The bearing housing on this particular engine stand (900kg/2000lb) is 89mm.

Alcohol is well known to burn up b1 and a lot of the body wide damage comes from that. B1 is not present much in many foods so you won't get good levels back fast via normal eating.  B1 is also a vitamin that it's nearly impossible to overdose on so it's pretty safe. Take daily for at least a few months to help recover from past damage, if there is a lot of damage, years are recommended, it is possibly to slowly regain some of the lost brain function by doing this.  If you should fall off the alcohol wagon (or for anyone still drinking), be sure to take b1 daily that entire time to protect your brain function. Try to take the b1 pill when there is no alcohol going down with it if possible for better absorption.  Good luck.",youtube,Fg7U-BhiZGE,2025-05-27T06:56:45Z,People & Blogs,1

So if the book says 4hrs, then they will charge 4hrs at their shop rate, say $100/hr. So $400.
Now if they invest in tools, equipment and training and get the job done in 10min, it is still a $400 job, you are not getting inferior parts or work, so it has the same value.
What your are likely to find is that they will sharpen their pencil some to be more competitive than other local shops, but they certainly would not charge for only 10min work.
This often works the other way too. If they take 5hrs to do a 4hr job, you will find they  will wear the loss. I don't see this as being dishonest at all.",youtube,qBc1Ba-0o9E,2018-11-19T10:58:57Z,Autos & Vehicles,2

Headphones and speakers can sound very different so it’s good to have a more neutral speaker give a truer sound to the recording. Your take on how the headphones make the recording sound better in this instance seems misunderstood. For example, Beats headphones increase the bass of the recording, whereas these headphones are supposed to tell the person mixing if they need to add more bass to the recording. 

If all you’re doing is listening to movies, music and games, then the focus would more so be on what sounds best for what you listen to as well as how good they feel.

Alcohol is well known to burn up b1 and a lot of the body wide damage comes from that. B1 is not present much in many foods so you won't get good levels back fast via normal eating.  B1 is also a vitamin that it's nearly impossible to overdose on so it's pretty safe. Take daily for at least a few months to help recover from past damage, if there is a lot of damage, years are recommended, it is possibly to slowly regain some of the lost brain function by doing this.  If you should fall off the alcohol wagon (or for anyone still drinking), be sure to take b1 daily that entire time to protect your brain function. Try to take the b1 pill when there is no alcohol going down with it if possible for better absorption.  Good luck.",youtube,Fg7U-BhiZGE,2025-05-27T06:56:45Z,People & Blogs,1

The old technique was more productive during some period, where there were not enough people to watch over vast farming area at early stages of the rice paddy. The dynamism changed now with farmable land is decreasing fast, while population rising at alarming rate. Blindly applying those techniques is counter productive now, since you have less plants, and cost for fertilizer, weed, pest control chemical would eat into the profit, yet this old inorganic method doesn't promote natural growth of the rice paddy plant.

When exploring new terrain, to turn an established field with other weeds into rice paddy ready, the fastest way to wipe them out is to flood the whole field and drowned them. Rice plant survives the flooding and take over. You can't just randomly throw seeds into flooding water, so in turn you have to terminate seeds, and transplant once it!s sprouting. This method is shorter-ism since it relies on previously good soil. The more you flood the soil, the more you change the local eco system. This land later become wetland which brings new pest, and invasive weeds.

  I'll do my best to answer your questions. 

  The pen kit I was using was the Classic from Penn State: www.pennstateind.com. 

  I also purchased the Shella Wax from Pen State. I don't have a local Woodcraft so I'm not sure if they carry the Shella Wax brand but they do carry other shellac based pen finishes. 

  I made that video several years ago and quite a bit has changed in my refinishing method. 

  I use punches to remove the nib, transmission, and ferrel from the pen. For the classic, I would still have to tape the trim ring because it's glued on but most other pens can be completely disassembled.
 
  Once disassembled, you can use your normal pen mandrel and bushings to refinish the pen. 

  The original finish on that pen was Crystal Coat and Hut wax. If the pen had C/A on it, it would require sanding to remove that finish as opposed to just using the EEE Polish.
 
  I also no longer use Shella Wax for finishing pens. I love SW for items that are not handled often, like ornaments, because it looks terrific. Pens are handled daily and I found SW just didn't hold up. I now use C/A glue to finish all my wood and antler pens.
 
  I have several videos that explain the C/A technique I use if your interested. The brand of C/A I prefer is Insta-Bond and I get it from Packard Woodworks: www.packardwoodworks.com. 

  I sincerely hope this information helps.

Zanzibaris wanted more relations with fellow Africans such Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, some sort of pan-African movement was afoot, but Arabs wanted more relations with socialist Egypt. Zanzibaris wanted to be seen as equals with the ruling Arab elite and rule along side with them but the Arabs were too arrogant for that. So the Arabs said they would hold elections and if they won they would rule along side them and the Zanzibaris agreed. Of course the elections were rigged in favour of the Arabs but the Zanzibaris saw through them and asked them how is it that towns with African majorities would vote for Arabs instead of them. Arabs replied it's because you're stupid. So then they began the massacre of the Arabs, when the Zanzibaris had defeated them and demoralised them from fighting any further they took up government.

If your repair skill is up to the task, you can dig into HK-47's memory to learn of previous masters. One of the earliest was a Mandolorian who claimed HK and ranked up by sending HK against his own superiors... until he tried this against Mandalor himself.



Alas, HK-47 couldn't defeat the leader of the Mandolorians and was reprogrammed to terminate his own master.

Honestly, his history of masters is like a parable about people using HK to kill without repercussions for a while, only for that same deadly tool to backfire on them.",youtube,J9AZ-eadA2I,2025-03-09T06:59:13Z,Film & Animation,4

Notice the context? Jesus said “do not heap up ‘empty phrases’ (Gr. – battalagesete,  which means to stammer, babble, prate, or to repeat the same things over and over mindlessly) as the Gentiles do…” We have to remember that the main idea of prayer and sacrifice among the pagans was to appease the gods so that you could go on with your own life. You had to be careful to “take care of” all of the gods by mentioning them, and saying all the right words, lest you bring a curse upon yourself.
And remember as well, the gods themselves were immoral at times! They were selfish, cruel, vengeful etc. The pagans would say their incantations, offer their sacrifice, but there was no real connection between the moral life and the prayer. Jesus is saying that this will not cut it in the New Covenant Kingdom of God! One must pray from a heart of repentance and submission to God’s will. But does Jesus mean to exclude the possibility of devotions like the Rosary or the Divine Mercy Chaplet which repeat prayers? No, he does not. This becomes evident when, in the very next verses of Matthew 6, Jesus says:

Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

Jesus gave us a prayer to recite! But notice the emphasis on living the words of the prayer! This is a prayer to be recited, but they are neither “empty phrases” nor “vain repetitions.”

Consider the prayers of the angels in Revelation 4:8:

And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!”

These “four living creatures” refer back to four angels, or “Seraphim,” that Isaiah saw as revealed in Is. 6:1-3 about 800 years earlier, and guess what they were praying?

In the year that King Uzzi’ah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”

Someone needs to inform these angels about “vain repetition!” According to many of our Protestant friends, especially Fundamentalists, they need to knock it off and pray something different! They’d been praying like that for ca. 800 years!",youtube,JgtJ-sFzWww,2022-09-13T05:49:40Z,Entertainment,2

The whole metafictional self-aware thing feels like it sidesteps any further character development and makes Yuri and Natsuki in particular feel like hollow caricatures.

Now before you ask this next question, do I still have them all? No, I sold 2 Animal Crossings, used 1 just for my own personal use, and still have 2 left untouched. Both my Splatoon 3 OLEDs are gone (by extremely high demand), but I can't wait to use my Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom edition sometime soon! It's just that I have invested so much of my free time invested into my Youtubing channel instead! I don't think I ever want to let go of the YouTube thing though -- I know it'll pay off for me in the very long run, and I'm happy things are really working out well on my end over here!

Sorry if I'm not selling anymore at the moment. I used to be heavy on the Squishmallows before they stopped shipping them in and I haven't seen anything new since February or March of this year! It's an amazing feeling to spend a few of these tickets to get all sorts of these high-end goodies! It's also really good promotion for the owners of this arcade that I collaborate with on their social media. People often ask me what prizes I can win at the arcade, and letting some people who swing by the arcade know what they have makes them come back for more.

12c35955-8915-489e-bbcc-162994d73fd9,354,,,id_354,"I would like to invite you to look into this dawa which the 12th imam is calling his ansar towards through his soul son Ahmad Al-Hassan and Abdullah Hashem ftip. We have named ourselves the ahmedi religion of piece and light. Because Islam has been hijacked by these none working scholars who also call themselves Muslims. And carrying this identity as a Muslim could confuse people to believe we are just another sect of Islam. 

We are calling the people towards the 7th and final covenant which god established with his messengers (Adam. Noah. Ibrahim. Musa. Isa. And Mohammed ftip). Today the 7th and final covenant is withheld by the 2 claimants of the Will of prophet mohammed fhip. Which are also the Two mahdis who are mentioned by name in the will of prophet mohammed fhip. 

So what is the value of this Will? 

• The one who claims this matter, what is his proof?
• he said: ‘He is asked about the halal and haram'. He said, then Ali came and said: ‘Three proofs do not gather in a person except that he is the companion of this matter: That he be the most deserving [of the right] of the one who was before him, that he has the weapon, and that he be the owner of the apparent will'. (Al-Kaﬁ by Al-Kulaini, vol. 1, p. 284) 

Apparent means that it is something evident amongst the people, it is known and accepted and it is not something that somebody just came up with. 

And Imam Ahmed Al-Hassan (From Him is Peace) claimed to be “Ahmed” in the will of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH & His Family) and that he is the vicegerent of Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and his family). 

• And Imam Al-Sadiq (From Him is Peace) said: 
“This is a matter that can not be claimed except by its companion, otherwise Allah would destroy the age of the one who falsely claims it”. (Al-Kaﬁ by Al-Kuleini volume 1 page 372) 

And we know that the Mahdi is the one who comes with the Will. 

• And from it, from Moalla Ibn Mohammed, from Mohammed Ibn Jamhour, from Musa, from Al Hannan, from Al Hars Ibn Al Mugheira who said, 

‘I said to Abu Abdullah (PBUH), ‘By what is the Master of this command recognised?’ He said: ‘By the tranquillity, and the dignity, and the knowledge, and the Will’’. - Basaair Al Darajaat – P 10 Ch 13 H 2 

Thus, the divine Will is protected by God and He the Almighty will cut off the life of anyone who claims it falsely. 
Therefore, Ahmed Al-Hassan and Abdullah Aba Al-Sadiq both claimed the Will and are therefore the rightful companions of the Will. They are the successors whom we should hold tight to in this day and age…Peace and mercy is from them.


• This matter will not be claimed except by the rightful owner, or else Allah will cut off his age.” - Al-Kafi, Al-Shaikh Al-Kulayni, Vol. 1, p. 373, Bihar Al-Anwar, Al-Allamah Al-Majlisi, Vol. 25, p. 112 

He also fits the description of the the name of the Mahdi in the books of the Sunni:
Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas’ud: 

• The Prophet (PBUH & His Family) said: If only one day of this world remained. Allah would lengthen that day (according to the version of Za'idah), till He raised up in it a man who belongs to me or to my family whose father's name is the same as my father's, who will fill the earth with equity and justice as it has been filled with oppression and tyranny. - Sunan Abi Dawud, Abi Dawud, Book of The Promised Deliverer, Hadith No. 4282 

One of the names of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH & His Family) was “Abdullah.”
• On the authority of Abu Dawood, who heard from Prophet Mohammad (PBUH & His Family) saying: 

""I am Abdullah whose name is Ahmad.” - Bihar Al-Anwar, Al-Allamah Al-Majlisi, Vol. 24, p. 397; Tafsir Al-Ayashi, Mohammed ibn Masoud Al-Ayashi, Vol. 1, p. 44. 

So where is this Will of prophet Muhammad which mentioned Ahmad and Abdullah? 

• O Ali, there will be twelve Imams after me and after them there will be twelve Mahdis. So you, O Ali, are the first of the twelve Imams, Allah The Exalted has named you in His heavens Ali Al-Mortadha (Ali the Content), Amirul Mo’mineen (the Commander of the Believers), Al-Siddiq Al-Akbar (the Greater Truthful), Al-Farouq Al-A’tham (the Greater Judge and Differentiator between truth and falsehood), Al-Ma’moun (the Trusted), and the Mahdi (the Rightly Guided). These names may not be attributed to other than you. O Ali, you are my Vicegerent/Guardian on my own family, their living and their dead, and upon my women: Whomever I kept, she shall find me tomorrow, and whomever I divorced, I am innocent of her, I will not see her and she will not see me on the Day of Resurrection. And you are my Successor (Khalifa) on my nation after me. If death comes to you, hand it over to my son Al-Hassan, the Righteous and Benevolent. Then if death comes to him, let him hand it over to my son Al-Hussein, the Martyr, the Pure and Murdered. If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, the Master of Worshippers, Dhul Thafant (the one with hard skin on his knees) Ali. If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Mohammed Al-Baqir (the Revealer of Knowledge). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Ja’far Al-Sadiq (the Truthful). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Musa Al-Kadhim (the Patient). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Ali Al-Ridha. If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Mohammed Al-Thiqa Al-Taqqi (the Trustworthy, the God-Fearing). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Ali Al-Nasih (the Advisor). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Al-Hassan Al-Fadhil (the Meritorious). If death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, Mohammed the Safeguarded of the Family of Mohammed, peace be upon them. Those are the twelve Imams. Then there will be twelve Mahdis after him, so if death comes to him, let him hand it over to his son, the first of the close ones, he has three names, one like mine and my father’s and it is Abdullah (Servant of God), and Ahmed (the Praised), and the third name is Al-Mahdi (the Guided) and he is the first of the believers.” 

– Al-Ghayba, Mohammed ibn Al-Hassan ‘Al-Toosi’, 3rd ed., p. 150, hadith 111 – Bihar Al-Anwar, Mohammed Baqir Al-Majlisi, 3rd ed., v.36, p.260-261, hadith 81 and v.53, p.147-148, hadith 6. 

So now that the proof of the Will has been established. It should be obligatory on yourself to seek further information on this matter. Which you can obtain from the below mentioned website. 

https://theahmadireligion.org/ 

Finally I would just like to leave you with a message from the qaim of ahlybayt. 

• All people who come across this call and hear the proofs and the call which I am making have an obligation to support this call with everything that they have, and to pledge allegiance, and that is what I am calling for. I am here to take people’s allegiance to Imam Mahdi (PBUH And His Family) and to call them to pledge allegiance to Imam Mahdi (PBUH And His Family), 

for whoever does not know the Imam of the time will die the death of ignorance.” – The Qaim of The Family of Mohammed Abdullah Hashem Aba Al-Sadiq (From Him is Peace).",youtube,-Bg3z-m7Zes,2025-03-08T02:37:20Z,People & Blogs,5

We owe everything to Jesus Christ who saves us and gives us new life. The Rosary is one of the greatest ways to contemplate his life, death, and resurrection. It makes us reflect his mysteries, and we have the woman who loved and suffered with him before everyone else as our guide towards him. I can't tell you how much peace the Rosary has given me or how many times I've sobbed knowing that I don't deserve His love.

If you really want scriptural basis, the ""Hail Mary"" is taken from the first chapter of Luke. John 19:26–27 is understood as Christ establishing the Church through his apostles and telling them to behold his mother as their own.

Yes, DDLC does have jumpscares, but it let's you get invested in the game to the point where the moment Sayori dies, it feels more scary than it would if it took only a few minutes to get to that point. And from that point on, you're constantly on edge. Let's compare that to another game with a similar concept: Baldi's Basics. In Baldi's Basics, it takes about a minute for things to go wrong, so you don't really feel much fear because you haven't really been emotionally connected with anything in the game. Besides, the jumpscares don't really happen often, usually it's characters having their personalities becoming more aggressive or obsessive, which I'd say works for the story that Dan Salvato is telling.",youtube,krq6-1ht_kk,2019-10-14T01:54:24Z,Gaming,1

There is nothing more comforting or cathartic than sin. That's what makes it so tempting. Who are you to take away an alcoholic's bottle, when it brings him so much joy and pleasure? When Jesus befriended the outcasts, downtrodden, and prostitutes, it wasn't because he approved of their behaviour, it was to minister to them. The healthy don't need doctors, the sick do. His love wasn't to condone them, but to improve them.

Getting that white picket fence has been getting easier and easier for gay people every year for a long time now, but if anything, the percentage of gay people actively shunning a conventional lifestyle and participating in ""transgressive subcultures"" has only exploded in that same period of time. It's almost as if people who identify as *queer* don't want to have a *conventional* lifestyle. The LGBT movement was super concerned with proving to heterosexual people that they were just as normal as straight people until the majority of people started to agree with them.
Now they seem out to prove the exact opposite. Now the gay people who want that white picket fence are shunned as ""homonormative"" Uncle Tom integrationists by queer activists. Hell, I've seen people in the LGBT movement who sincerely believe that getting gay marriage was BAD for gay people because it made them more likely to live content homonormative lives outside of any transgressive or revolutionary subcultures.

Also, RZ is a Calvinist. He believes that EVERYONE is naturally depraved and inclined to sin (even himself), NO ONE (even himself) actually DESERVES Heaven and EVERYONE (even himself) is a sinner who DESERVES Hell, and everyone who receives Heaven only does so because of their faith in God's grace. The damned are getting what they deserve, and the sanctified are getting better than they deserve, thanks to Jesus being punished in their place.

That trans person's friend who committed suicide? Sinner. Heck, suicide is one of the Top Ten No-Nos.

I understand why this might not be very comforting. It's not. But it's not supposed to be. It is demanding. It asks you to be better than you are. It asks you to be better than you can be. But it also forgives you when, not if, you're not. Calvinists also believe that those God elects to save WILL be saved, once and forever. RZ has faith that his eternal salvation is out of his sinful and depraved hands, but in the hands of Jesus. THAT is what is supposed to be comforting.",youtube,E8zj-jtNh6U,2023-09-22T07:11:20Z,People & Blogs,2

Blade's hero journey is that he is not perfect and the only things that make sense are his family, who he must now turn against. The power he has is his only hope but when that is stripped away he must put aside his raging pain and is forced to place his trust and love in those who accept he is broken and see him as his new family. Pegas is a creation of the Space Knights, just as he was a creation of the Radam/Venomoids. As Star says ""it doesn't matter where your power came from, it's how you use it that matters.""

Now earlier in 2021 (before I had a YouTube channel) I was making a bit of money off of my winnings. I normally spend $20 to $30 per session (which is basically a few hours down by the arcade each day sometimes) because the tickets come out of the machines the old school way. Waiting for a thousand tickets to come out normally takes 7-8 minutes each jackpot. Then you got the game techs to wait for if the tickets in the machine run out and then to shove all those winnings into the ticket eater sometimes take 90 min depending on how much I won.

It balances out and I lose money because I do play dance games and pinball games that don't give out tickets. At the end, it pretty much balances out. I tell everyone pretty much if you think you can make a living off of this it's better to just buy the PS5 or the Nintendo Switch etc. outright. I pretty much stretch my budget out and it normally equals the same, so if I spend $450 on a Switch for example, I stretch out about $400-500 in 4 weeks and then play those 4 weeks throughout. Gets good publicity (I realized), the owners of the arcade love it and so many people suggested I get a YouTube channel way too many times! I only got into it in 2023 since my hiatus began (too much work, trying to catch up in life. Etc.)

On a good day, I can win about 7000 tickets with $20. Hope that answers your question and thanks for dropping by!

I guess my confusion lies in why an object is needed when there isn't one present in the Bible? Everyone just prays to God directly. Also, why repeat ""hail mary"" continuously? Does that do something extra? I understand the angel said that to Mary, but it was just a greeting, and he said it once. I mean, why pray to Mary at all? The Bible never commands such a thing, and it doesn't really even make sense in concept.

It gets better once you are able to set new goals, desires, etc whether for yourself or a child maybe. But therapy, allowing time to grieve and taking care of yourself, such as sleep ( for me, oils help) allows to make new vision boards, goals, etc and that helps the process. But even as adult, we are always changing, growing and learning which triggers things and must go back to what helps. For me, being alone at times is necessary for me to move forward. Finding people that have walked in your shows whether as a parent of CHD or the patient itself is huge! Hope that helps and made somewhat sense:) Its hard, but the older you get, you see the grief as being something that saved you!",instagram,,,,2

Many parents use it at meal times, they allow their children to leave the vegetables and food they don’t want to eat then allow them to deal with the consequences of being hungry later, it’s also a technique used in schools. They hope to scare you so much with one detention so you never get another. The whole point of parenting like this is to stop children making the same mistakes. Her son was fine, the consequences weren’t too bad for him but chances are he won’t forget his lunch again anytime soon. You also have to think about how it affects ruby and her life. She choose to have 6 kids and it’s therefore her responsibility to be a mother to all of them, however she has so much to do. The school they go to is quite far away and would take her awhile to get there, which would waste a large section of her day. It would cause much more suffering in response. Either her son goes without lunch once, or she misses out on a few hours of things she usually does which will affect her entire family just because one one persons mistake.",instagram,,,,2

Meaning it can resistance random contact with water. “Waterproof” actually means it can resist total water intrusion for any length of time at a reasonable depth. Life Proof females a good case. But it’s not waterproof. I can assure you that you don’t want to drop it in a pool and leave it there for the night. What Lifeproof does do a fantastic job of is marketing. How else could you sell a case that costs less than $8 including packaging to make in China and deliver anywhere for $100? My only grip is that they be more honest with people and just say it’s Water Resistant. :),instagram,,,,2

If this Bakery didn’t offer nutritional info, I would’ve looked up the info for a maple long john at a chain like Dunkin or Starbucks. It doesn’t have to be exact, one loosely tracked meal once in a while won’t derail your progress ☺️ and if it’s just too stressful to try and guess and track, I just don’t! 🤷🏼‍♀️ memories over macros. Obviously in that case, I try to be mindful if I can, but I also enjoy myself. Instances like that usually don’t have every day so it’s not really a big deal.

We can collaborate but if the end goal is not profit it just won’t happen unless you receive funding from people who climbed their way up. Sometimes shortcuts create the best outcomes, the easy was is to sacrifice everything we enjoy for the greater good and plunge ourselves into mental depression out of fear that we don’t offend someone or hurt the environment in some way. If the earth were clean and perfect then the people who get paid to say climate change is an issue would lose their jobs so. There has to be some sort of ongoing crisis otherwise organizations taking billions today would be proven frauds.",instagram,,,,2

Some things don't have to be done daily. Make dahi baras once for the week and freeze and use. Boil cholay once in week and freeze and use. Have a pakora mix ready in a jar. Cook in stages. Do laundry in stages - actually I fold mine all over the week. It seems endless I agree. Sometimes I wash before weekend even starts then I fold over the weekend but that's bcoz I go to work during the week. U may want to do all such chores during the week. Take care of urself Mama.

You can visit Lombard Street, take a trolley ride, visit The Full House house, hike in Muir Woods (closest place to see the beautiful red trees), take a day trip to Napa. Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39 is overrated in my opinion but as a first timer doesn't hurt to see it. Take a ferry ride under the golden gate bridge, visit Alcatraz. If you have an extended stay I'd highly recommend visiting Yosemite National Park and then if you want to see more giant sequoias (red trees) you can drive an hour from there to Sequoia National Park. If you want beautiful coastline views you can drive Highway 1 south to Monterey for a cute quaint town and the aquarium there is really nice. Hope this helps!",instagram,,,,4

That's completely different than them forgetting their lunch. I was abused and neglected as a child and I will make damn sure my kids at least have decent meals, regardless if they forgot it or not.

As a younger child the day “started” at 4 am (not that he slept through until that time) and although these days I don’t have to get up with him, he wanders around his room all night and I can still hear him. On bad nights he still wakes me several times. 
We have quite literally tried everything 😂😂 but I have now moved to acceptance. 
My pet hate is the implication from people you meet that some how this is a parental failing when a small handful of children genuinely have significant issues with sleep. My son was 3 years old the first time he slept for 4 hours out of 24 (I remember it soooo well as it was a one off) and anyone who imagines I didn’t try every single thing I could think of has no idea 😂😂 He has no access to TV or WiFi at night but it makes no difference. 
In our case this is part of his autism but lack of sleep for any reason is extremely hard and I feel for you. 
My younger two children sleep well (7 am!) and my middle son was a very early riser until he was part of the way through primary but it got better over time so it definitely does happen-  I have my fingers crossed for you! 💕 #solidarityforthesleepless",instagram,,,,1

But studies only tell us what it looks like at a group level. Which is why I think the statement that retinoids and benzoyl counteract each others effectiveness is misleading, since it is contrary to scientific evidence. But yes as you say, dryness and peeling from epiduo should be a common side effect of the drug. Personally I have only bad experience from benzoyl peroxide and would not apply it all over face.  I would like to try short contact therapy tho, applying only to spots.  Where did you read epiduo can lead to rosacea? If any severe reaction is caused by the drug it should subside with discontinued use? In my understanding Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder, episodic, and with unknown etiology. But yes a flare-up might be triggered by topical products. I agree with you that everyone has to listen to their skin and that balance is key! 🙌🏻",instagram,,,,1

I am a mom of 4 who gas also suffered with chronic illness over the years. Loving my kids isn't hard. There are many aspects of caring for them that are though. I am just being honest. But I chose to do those hard things because of my love for my children, three of which have varying degrees if special needs. I have 3 grown and 1 ten year old who struggles with anxiety which can be very hard to watch her struggle with. By far the hardest for me is being a parent of adults, all of whom I am so grateful to be their mom! Motherhood is more defined as our kids are...well, kids. I do agree with you Hannah, that toys on the floor or dirty counters are not what matters most but loving on your kiddos and letting them know nothing will ever change that love. I tell my kids they can always talk to me about anything and I will do my best to be there for them whenever humanly possible. I love that God loves them even more than I ever can! He does that unconditionally! I pray THAT is the type of love I am able to express to them💗",instagram,,,,6

The narrows is probably the best/coolest hike I’ve ever been on. We camped, so I don’t really have food recommendation except we got margaritas at a Mexican restaurant just outside the park and I liked them (but I don’t discriminate when it comes to margs I mostly love them all). For the Grand Canyon, we hiked all the way down to the Colorado River and it was awesome. But long and tiring. If you’re going into the canyon no matter how far start early, it does get really hot! We took the Bright Angel trail and had a pretty long pit stop in Indian Garden which was lovely and worth it even if you don’t get all the way down.

I’m lucky enough to have a 6 year old with my husband but we would love another. I had two miscarriages just this year and can’t seem to get pregnant. I have pcos which means tracking ovulation is an absolute mission lol I use ovulations sticks- 3 of them a clearblue fertility monitor, and a clearblue digital 🤣🤣 and I log on my app to see if it can give me any kind of algorithm. BUT nope lol. Please don’t take to heart anything people say. I know you’re sensitive I am too but I would love to hear your fertility journey.

I was vegatarian years before I was vegan and both can be super duper tasty and healthy! You can use the same sauces and herbs on your meat substitutes or vegtables! You will find vegtables have wayyy less calories than meat yet way more protein. I actually lost 8 pounds recently on a high protein vegan dieet🤗 with no hunger. Please follow hashtags as #veganfood #plantbasedrecipes #veganweightloss etc. Etc. And try to make lots of vegan friends on insta most of us post yummy recipies!
